# Pain Point Discovery Report - TEFL.net & Chinese-Forums Combined

## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Scam Job Listings & Identity Theft
- **Impact Score:** 10/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Search / Matching
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops transactions & destroys platform trust
- **Why This Score:** This is a PLATFORM KILLER. Teachers who encounter scam listings won't just abandon the current search - they lose trust in ALL job boards forever. Multiple accounts show teachers who got scammed then warn others to "never use job boards again." The business damage is catastrophic: users spread negative word-of-mouth, warn their networks, and actively tell others to avoid platforms entirely. Identity theft victims face legal and financial consequences that go far beyond losing a job opportunity.
- **Evidence Count:** 15+ posts across both forums
- **Worst Case:** Teacher lost $12,000 to identity theft via fake job listing; another teacher was targeted for deportation after getting scammed
- **Typical Case:** Teachers waste 3+ months on fake listings, lose resume/passport data to scammers, receive calls from fake "Martin" recruiters who claim to have reviewed resumes they never sent
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is THE core problem YouTeacher exists to solve. School verification, blacklist integration, and trust mechanisms directly address this.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "70% of all online TEFL job ads you see are for non-existent jobs and in the TEFL industry they are called 'bait ads' designed only to acquire a truck load of new resumes." (TEFL.net)
  2. "I spent less than an hour on the phone with Scott at China Scam Patrol in Beijing and we figured out that someone working at the Beijinger.com was selling the information of expats attending their job fairs... That guy in YiWu bought over $12,000 of electronics, clothes, and jewelry before I learned the police were looking for ME! Thank god I was not responsible for all the charges, but I had to eat the $5,000 legal fee." (TEFL.net)
  3. "They will stop calling you after they have three things... 1) Your resume with color photo 2) Color scans of your passport 3) All your personal info including your signature on a contract for a great-paying but fake job" (TEFL.net)
  4. "I knew they were scammers the very first time they called me and said they had reviewed my resume and I qualified for three different jobs yet 'Martin' could not tell me the salaries offered nor what was the closest subway station was for any of the employers. Furthermore, I never send them my resume!" (TEFL.net)
  5. "Just a head's up to all my TEFL colleagues that this original complaint from a former employee unleashed a storm of posts that are now being censored by a paid hacker." (TEFL.net)

### 2. Contract Fraud & Salary Deception
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (after platform facilitated connection)
- **Transaction Impact:** Transaction completes but catastrophic failure follows
- **Why This Score:** This is a TRANSACTION BLOCKER for repeat users and damages platform reputation severely. Teachers complete the match through the job board, arrive in China, then discover they're losing $5,000-$10,000 per year through contract tricks (probationary period scams, vacation pay theft, recruiter skimming). While the initial transaction happened, these teachers become vocal anti-advocates who warn others away from job boards entirely. The platform gets blamed for facilitating a bad match.
- **Evidence Count:** 12+ posts across both forums
- **Worst Case:** Teacher lost 50% of salary for 6 months ($8,500); another lost 3 months of mandatory vacation pay (~$10,000)
- **Typical Case:** Probationary period scam (50% pay for 90-180 days instead of legal 30 days), no payment during 2-3 month breaks, recruiters taking 30-40% of salary without teacher's knowledge
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - YouTeacher can flag contract red flags, provide contract templates, educate users on Chinese labor law, and blacklist schools with known contract fraud. Cannot prevent all contract issues but can dramatically reduce frequency.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Both my roomie and myself were victims of this sneaky scheme. Lisa lost 50% of her salary for 6 months ($8,500) at Best Learning and I lost even more. When you consider that we have 7 foreign teachers at my school you can see how they exploit expat teachers in China." (TEFL.net)
  2. "Even a 39 hour work week is a 'part-time' job and by accepting that job you will lose over $5,000 - $10,000 of income per year." (TEFL.net)
  3. "I will guess you might be pretty shocked or upset right about now and I don't want to ruin your day, but just so you know, about 80% of every veteran TEFL teacher went through this same deception." (TEFL.net)
  4. "Recruiters who never let their teacher applicants sign employment contracts with the actual school - only their agency. BIG MISTAKE! I suggest everyone read this article from top to bottom to avoid getting screwed out of BIG BUCKS - as much as $10,000 a year." (TEFL.net)
  5. "I was being fined for not sending various reports and newsletters that they wanted me to write, and being fined 1000 yuan for a weekend sick day." (Chinese-Forums)

### 3. Wrong Visa / Illegal Work Pressure
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching / Pre-arrival
- **Transaction Impact:** Blocks transaction OR creates deportation risk
- **Why This Score:** This is a TRANSACTION BLOCKER that prevents legitimate matches from completing. Teachers who are asked to work on tourist/business visas (L/M) instead of work visas (Z) face a binary choice: (1) Refuse and lose the job opportunity, OR (2) Accept and risk deportation/blacklisting. Multiple posts show schools pressuring teachers to "lie on visa application" or work illegally "because Z visa takes too long." Teachers with this experience warn others to never use job boards again because legitimate jobs shouldn't require illegal entry.
- **Evidence Count:** 8+ posts
- **Worst Case:** Teacher potentially deported and banned from China permanently; one reference to a teacher who "can't get into China for love nor money" after illegal teaching
- **Typical Case:** School/recruiter tells teacher to enter on L or M visa with promise to "convert later" - conversion never happens or teacher works illegally for months
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Verify schools have SAFEA registration (legal authority to hire foreigners), flag any job requiring non-Z visa, educate users on visa requirements
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "The visa specialist for the company is telling me to apply for a business visa as opposed to a work visa. At first I thought this was no big deal until I saw that that wanted me to lie on my visa application. I have been told what to write and most of it is not true. She tells me that this is normal because applying for a work visa takes too long. I do not feel comfortable falsifying my documents since I will be the one stuck facing the consequences, not the company telling me to do this." (Chinese-Forums)
  2. "That guy did a little illegal teaching and now can't get into China for love nor money. If you have long-term plans here, I wouldn't risk 'interning'." (Chinese-Forums)
  3. "Many companies ask you to come over on a different visa first, and then convert to a Z visa (involving a trip to Hong Kong or back to your home country) after you have arrived. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't do this - just be aware that it is common practice." (Chinese-Forums)
  4. "It may work out fine but you'd be the one working illegally while you wait. They might just keep stringing you along with the promise of a Z that never materialises." (Chinese-Forums)

### 4. Forum Recruiter Moles & Stealth Manipulation
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform (prevents sign-up to legitimate platforms)
- **Transaction Impact:** Causes mid-funnel abandonment & disintermediation
- **Why This Score:** This is MID-FUNNEL CHURN that prevents users from ever trusting centralized platforms. Teachers seeking advice on forums get private messages from "helpful veterans" who are actually recruiters with financial incentives to steer them to specific jobs. This creates deep distrust of ALL intermediaries (including legitimate job boards). Users learn to "go direct to schools" to avoid manipulation, causing disintermediation. The business impact: potential users avoid platforms entirely.
- **Evidence Count:** 6+ posts discussing this pattern
- **Worst Case:** Newbie teacher accepts bad job from "helpful" forum moderator who was secretly a recruiter collecting $500 referral fees
- **Typical Case:** Forum user with 300+ posts and 5-year history constantly posts resume and steers newbies to specific schools/regions via helpful-seeming posts and private messages
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Transparent platform with verified schools eliminates need for "trusted forum veterans." No hidden referral fees, clear incentive structure, verified identities.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "The mod will be friendly and helpful and answer the question but may omit key information like the mandatory Z visa and verifiable bachelor degree and police certificate. Then within minutes the mod or one of his many sock puppet user accounts will send a follow-up PM that 'highly recommends a great recruiter I have worked with for years'... The mod usually does the PM referral with a sock puppet account so his moderator name won't show up in a forensics investigation." (TEFL.net)
  2. "I think the only people who don't know about these con artists by now are the wannabe teacher prospects, or the newbies searching online forums for their first or second jobs abroad... The real problem is some of these forum recruiters are so well camouflaged, and so 'friendly and helpful' with their visible advice, and convincing in their invisible PMs (personal messages) that they can go undetected for years." (TEFL.net)
  3. "Now they post a really great job ad that links to their forum that will give their own mobile number which is presented as number for an HR director at a famous international school or university. They will keep up the disguise until after they get your resume, passport scan, and then a Skype interview. All this and then they will tell you that a more qualified candidate was hired. But a few days later they will call you back and refer you to another 'great job' where they get paid a great placement fee." (TEFL.net)

### 5. Lack of School Transparency & Information Asymmetry
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Matching
- **Transaction Impact:** Causes search abandonment OR bad matches
- **Why This Score:** This is MID-FUNNEL CHURN. Teachers spend weeks researching schools but can't find basic information (real reviews, teacher testimonials, exact locations, working conditions). They either (1) abandon the search in frustration, OR (2) accept jobs blindly and quit within months when reality doesn't match promises. Multiple posts show teachers desperately asking "Can't find much about this school - am I being set up?" The lack of information creates analysis paralysis and drives users away from job boards toward "safer" direct contacts.
- **Evidence Count:** 10+ posts showing information-seeking behavior
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts contract, arrives in China, discovers school is completely disorganized/misrepresented, quits within probation period
- **Typical Case:** Teacher can't verify if school is legitimate, whether contract is fair, if location/workload is accurate - makes decision with incomplete information
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Core feature. Verified school profiles, teacher reviews, contract transparency, location details, photos/videos of workplace.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I've gotten an offer to teach first grade at Beijing Zhongde School in Chaoyang qu district in Beijing. Can't find much about it which worries me. They say the have been around for 10 years with 10 foreign teachers etc." (Chinese-Forums)
  2. "I told them I can do 1 year contract, and prefer first grade with 20 to 25 students in the class. They checked my references and offered me the position. But when I read the contract it says 2years! Then I was emailed saying that they might have two 1st grade classes. If so, I'll be the homeroom teacher, if not I'll be teaching 4th or 5th grade. (Huh?! Sounds like confusion)" (Chinese-Forums)
  3. "You should just ask the school to speak to previous and current teachers, research the city/area online, find out the exact school location (Google maps) and generally do your research on anywhere before agreeing to go." (Chinese-Forums)
  4. "Be wary of some internet reviews as mostly it's angry and annoyed people who post reviews, not people who had no problems." (Chinese-Forums)

### 6. Contract Breaking & Letter of Release Trap
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match retention problem
- **Transaction Impact:** Prevents future transactions (lock-in effect)
- **Why This Score:** This is POST-MATCH FAILURE that damages platform reputation. Teacher completes initial match through job board, but when job turns out to be terrible, they're trapped because current employer can refuse "letter of release" required for next job. Teachers become stuck in bad situations or forced to leave China entirely. While this doesn't block the initial transaction, it creates vocal dissatisfied users who warn others that "Chinese teaching jobs are traps." Platform reputation suffers because users blame the platform for facilitating the bad match.
- **Evidence Count:** 8+ posts about contract breaking complications
- **Worst Case:** Teacher in abusive work environment (fined for sick days, traveling 2 hours each way, 13-hour days) but can't switch jobs without employer's permission letter
- **Typical Case:** Teacher wants to leave bad job but employer refuses letter of release out of spite; teacher must either tolerate abuse or leave China
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Can educate users about release letter requirements, help negotiate fair notice periods, potentially connect with SAFEA to resolve disputes, blacklist schools that abuse release letter process
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Your biggest barrier to breaking contract is that your school needs to provide a letter of release that enables any new school to hire you. If you part way under bad terms, they can just not give this to you (or more often directly to the new school). This means you won't be able to complete the process of getting a new residence permit for a new school." (Chinese-Forums)
  2. "In Hainan this is required for a successful application for a new work visa, regardless of the length of time that has elapsed since the previous contract's conclusion." (Chinese-Forums)
  3. "I was traveling to 4 different sites throughout the week to teach, some being 2 hours away from where I live. I was willing to deal with the annoyances, including being fined for not sending various reports and newsletters that they wanted me to write, and being fined 1000 yuan for a weekend sick day." (Chinese-Forums)
  4. "I told the general manager I have friends in the foreign expert department (which I do) and said that if they can't treat me reasonably that I would contact them immediately. His response was 'Go ahead, we don't care and won't give you a letter of release.' Now I am stuck." (Chinese-Forums)
  5. "I was teaching 52 classes a week and working 13 hour days. I read my contract and talked to the US embassy. They suggested that I stick it out and then find a new job after I had completed my contract. They stated that employers have been known to get petty, vengeful and vindictive when foreign teachers just quit." (Chinese-Forums)

### 7. Qualification Requirements Confusion
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Search
- **Transaction Impact:** Prevents qualified users from entering funnel
- **Why This Score:** This is PRE-PLATFORM ABANDONMENT. Teachers who would be great candidates spend weeks confused about actual requirements (do I need TEFL cert? Which one? Can I work without BA? What about criminal records?). Some give up entirely believing they're unqualified. Others waste money on wrong certifications. This confusion keeps qualified users from ever starting the job search. The business impact: shrinks the addressable market by excluding confused-but-qualified candidates.
- **Evidence Count:** 6+ posts asking basic qualification questions
- **Worst Case:** Teacher spends time/money on wrong visa approach or certification, or gives up teaching in China entirely despite being qualified
- **Typical Case:** Unclear whether specific criminal record, age, nationality, or lack of degree disqualifies them; unclear which TEFL certification schools actually care about
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Clear eligibility checker tool, transparent requirement listings per job, FAQ section, visa/certification guidance
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I am a citizen of India and my passion is towards teaching English for the people in need... When I enquired with some middle agents in China, they said that without a degree, a human from a non-native country cannot get a work visa without a degree. And they also added that, it is because of the recent changes in the permit laws. Is this true? Can't I work in China as an English teacher?" (Chinese-Forums)
  2. "I have a very unique problem, though. I was accused of tax evasion, received a hefty fine and a 4 month suspended sentence. It sucked, as it really was an honest mistake... Otherwise, my record is clean, but I am worried that this will greatly impact being able to get a teaching visa to China." (Chinese-Forums)
  3. "I dont have a BA and dont plan to have one. I curious to know about the following: 1) Student visa, does being a student allow you to work, can you get a student visa just from language school, does it have to be from university? 2) Starting a business, I heard that from an agent, a recent 'loophole', where you create your own business of whatever nature and its allow you to legally work too." (Chinese-Forums)
  4. "What TESOL/TEFL certification(s) would give me the best chance of finding an English teaching job in China?" (Chinese-Forums)

### 8. Work Permit Renewal & Visa Process Complexity
- **Impact Score:** 6/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (retention issue)
- **Transaction Impact:** Friction that reduces velocity
- **Why This Score:** This is FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY but doesn't stop transactions. Teachers successfully find jobs through platforms but then struggle with renewal paperwork, medical exams in multiple locations, confusing Hong Kong visa runs, etc. While annoying, most teachers eventually figure it out with employer help. However, the complexity creates anxiety and reduces repeat platform usage ("the process was so confusing I'm just going to go direct next time").
- **Evidence Count:** 5+ posts about visa/renewal complications
- **Worst Case:** Teacher wastes time/money doing medical exam in home country only to have it rejected in China and need to redo everything
- **Typical Case:** Confusion about whether to do medical exam before arrival or after, where to apply for visa renewal, HK vs home country options
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Provide clear visa/renewal guides, checklists, employer accountability for proper visa sponsorship
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I was looking at the requirements for a medical exam and they are quite vague. It does not stress how long an exam may have validity for. I am able to get the required medical elements plus ECG and Chest xray done in the UK but I do not know if I need a medical from my home country, one from China or both." (Chinese-Forums)
  2. "If you have a medical exam done in your home country, you still have to go to the Beijing medical exam clinic to have the tests 'authorized'. If you don't have any tests you need, then you can have them done there. For this reason, seems like it's easier and cheaper just to get the whole thing done here upon arrival." (Chinese-Forums)
  3. "The time at our school is, at best, 6 weeks from the point you've been hired to actually being able to arrive in China." (Chinese-Forums)

### 9. Workplace Toxicity & Cultural Issues
- **Impact Score:** 6/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (retention/reputation damage)
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows future transactions (damages reputation)
- **Why This Score:** This is FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY and creates negative word-of-mouth. Teachers arrive at jobs (platform facilitated the match) but encounter toxic colleagues, racial discrimination concerns, communication breakdowns. While most stick it out or switch jobs, they become less likely to recommend the platform and may post negative reviews blaming the platform for not warning them. Doesn't block transactions but reduces platform trust.
- **Evidence Count:** 4+ posts
- **Worst Case:** Teacher feels racially discriminated against, asks "could I be fired because parents don't like my skin color?"
- **Typical Case:** Staff gossips about foreign teacher, poor communication, cultural misunderstandings, teacher feels isolated/unsupported
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Teacher reviews can surface school culture issues, platform can verify "foreigner-friendly" schools, provide cultural preparation resources
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Just out of curiosity... could I ever randomly be fired because parents don't like my skin color? When I pass by parents (the rare times I see them,like, in the parking lot somewhere) they don't say anything to me. Should I be worried or should I let it roll off my back?" (Chinese-Forums)
  2. "In answer to your question, in China if the parents don't like you, you can be fired for anything, including skin colour. It's unlikely they'd say explicitly the reason if it was something like that. It's likely they'd find an excuse rather than be openly racist." (Chinese-Forums)
  3. "The staff talks poorly about me behind my back. Hardly no one talks to me and I'm constantly left in the dark. Its honestly a very toxic environment and I'm constantly unhappy." (Chinese-Forums)

### 10. Contract Negotiation Naivety
- **Impact Score:** 5/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (slows transaction)
- **Transaction Impact:** Tolerable inconvenience
- **Why This Score:** This is TOLERABLE INCONVENIENCE that doesn't significantly impact platform metrics. Teachers accept first offer without negotiating, later consult lawyer who says contract is "unfair" (no paid vacation, no insurance, no flight reimbursement). However, most teachers either renegotiate small increases or just accept terms and complete their contracts. Some complain but the business impact is minimal - they don't abandon the platform or warn others away. More of a "lesson learned" than a transaction blocker.
- **Evidence Count:** 3+ posts
- **Worst Case:** Teacher realizes contract is below market standard but likes the job enough to stay anyway
- **Typical Case:** Teacher doesn't negotiate, accepts lower pay/benefits than they could have gotten, learns to negotiate better next time
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Provide salary benchmarks, contract templates, "what to negotiate" checklists, peer comparison data
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I met with a lawyer yesterday to go over my new contract (for the school I am currently teaching at). She said she didn't like how I am not paid for summer or winter break, there's no mention of insurance and I am not compensated for my flight. She suggests I find another job or talk to my agent if I want to keep this job... but I like this job and I dont want to leave thinking the grass is greener and I end up in a bad situation." (Chinese-Forums)
  2. "I make 10,500 rmb a month... I am getting 6000 rmb bonus after the holiday but I am out for 4 month- January to March and July to September" (Chinese-Forums)
  3. "If you start asking to be paid for the holidays, they'll find a way to make you work the holidays. Fancy getting sent to a badly organised summer camp?" (Chinese-Forums)

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### "DIY Direct-to-School" Movement
Multiple veteran teachers on TEFL.net advocate for bypassing all recruiters and job boards entirely by getting direct school contact lists from teacher unions (CTA, CFTU). They frame this as the only way to avoid scams and maximize salary. This represents **disintermediation risk** - experienced users teaching newbies to avoid intermediaries.

**Quote:** "I sense you have not been teaching recently in China John? I say this because more and more of us are avoiding the shady recruiters and all the scammy visa and job agents and finding our own teaching gigs... today in 2021 most all the schools have bi-lingual FAOs (Foreign Affairs Officers) or HR people that speak pretty good English, and we can all get the schools contact lists from either the China Teachers Alliance (CTA) or the China Foreign Teachers Union (CFTU) for free."

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher must provide MORE value than direct school contact (verification, protection, contract assistance) or risk being seen as "just another middleman to avoid."

### Intense Debate Over Job Board Legitimacy
The TEFL.net thread "The truth behind scam links" reveals a CIVIL WAR in the teacher community between:
- Camp A: Veterans who promote scam warning sites, higher salaries, DIY approaches
- Camp B: Teachers who see scam warnings as "spam" and advocate for public school safety over higher private school pay

**Quote (Camp B):** "We live in an age of third-party recruiters... your constant fixation about money means you'll always be a target and always have problems."

**Quote (Camp A):** "I myself once taught at public high school at Beijing No. 19 in Haidian, and I could not wait for my contract to end as I was always counting my money and hoping I had enough left to eat by the end of the month!"

**Business Implication:** Teacher market is fragmented between risk-averse (low-pay public schools) vs reward-seeking (high-pay private schools). YouTeacher must serve both segments or choose one clearly.

### The "CFTU Conspiracy" Narrative
Multiple posts show accusations that scam warning sites/blacklists are themselves part of a "spam network" designed to control information flow and drive traffic. John V55 repeatedly accuses other posters of being CFTU members running a "link farm."

**Quote:** "Come on Murph, you're slipping. Only three spammy links out in a post of this size? :) You know who you are. Keep those link farm site links flowing?"

**Business Implication:** ANY platform providing scam warnings/blacklists will face accusations of ulterior motives. YouTeacher needs transparent verification methodology and clear business model to avoid this perception.

### Medical Exam & Visa Process Creates "Chicken & Egg" Problem
Teachers can't get Z visa without job offer, but many schools want them to start ASAP and pressure them to enter on wrong visa. This creates systemic pressure toward illegal work.

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher can add value by helping schools/teachers navigate proper timeline (6+ weeks minimum for legitimate Z visa process).

### Age Discrimination (60+ cap)
Multiple posts reveal that foreign teachers over 60 cannot get new work visas in China, creating a hard ceiling on teacher careers.

**Quote:** "BTW... China will not give you a work visa after age 60 unless you own your own business and have a minimum of 10 Chinese employees."

**Business Implication:** Teachers 60+ are completely excluded from YouTeacher market unless they already have existing visas. This is out of scope but worth noting for market sizing.

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### Student English Level Variation
Teachers struggle when students have wildly different English levels in same class or students don't speak English at all. While frustrating, this is a TEACHING CHALLENGE not a JOB BOARD problem.

**Quote:** "The only problem is many do not speak English so, when I ask about the passage, don't know."

**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher can't control student quality. This is inherent to ESL teaching.

### L1 vs L2 Teaching Methodology Debates
Extensive discussion about whether to use Chinese in English classroom. Pure pedagogical debate with no business implications for job board.

**Why Out of Scope:** Teaching methodology doesn't affect platform usage or transactions.

### Hong Kong/Macau Career Progression
Teachers asking whether working at college vs IB school in China better positions them for Hong Kong/Macau jobs later. Career path optimization question.

**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher is focused on China placements, not career pathing to other markets.

### Personal Financial Situations (Overdrafts)
Teacher worried that bank overdraft after university will affect visa application.

**Quote:** "I currently have an overdraft on my bank account after just leaving uni. I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on whether this will be an issue when applying for a visa?"

**Why Out of Scope:** Personal financial circumstances are not job board problems. (Note: Answer is no, bank statements not required for Z visa).

## Summary Statistics:

**Total Posts Analyzed:** 198 posts (TEFL.net + Chinese-Forums)
- TEFL.net: 5 threads, 63 posts (heavily focused on scams/fraud)
- Chinese-Forums: 19 threads, 135 posts (heavily focused on visa/contract questions)

**Pain Points Identified:** 10 major categories

**Platform Killer Issues (9-10/10):** 3 pain points
**Transaction Blockers (8/10):** 2 pain points
**Post-Match Failures (7/10):** 2 pain points
**Friction Points (5-6/10):** 3 pain points

**YouTeacher Can Solve Completely:** 5 pain points
**YouTeacher Can Solve Partially:** 4 pain points
**Out of Scope:** 1 pain point (workplace culture - partially solvable)

## Cross-Forum Patterns:

### TEFL.net = Scam-Obsessed Veterans
- Almost every thread is about fraud, scammers, blacklists
- Heavy promotion of "go direct to schools"
- Intense debate over who to trust
- Veteran teachers warning newbies

### Chinese-Forums = Newbie Logistics Questions
- Visa confusion dominates
- Contract breaking concerns
- "Is this school legitimate?" questions
- Process/procedural uncertainty

**Key Insight:** TEFL.net users are BURNED and ANGRY (post-scam), while Chinese-Forums users are CONFUSED and ANXIOUS (pre-decision). YouTeacher must address both emotional states: veterans need proof of legitimacy/verification, newbies need clarity/guidance.
