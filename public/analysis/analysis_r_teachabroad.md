## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Scam Listings & Contract Fraud (Trust Destruction)
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 - PLATFORM KILLER
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform & During search
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Users won't trust job board at all
- **Why This Score:** Teachers who get scammed through job listings will never use a job board again. This destroys platform trust at the fundamental level. Multiple posts warn teachers to research carefully BEFORE applying, indicating deep mistrust of the entire marketplace. The "20% chance of becoming a scam victim" statistic shows systemic trust failure.
- **Evidence Count:** 5 posts directly about scams/fraud
- **Worst Case:** Teachers lose deposits, get deported, suffer identity theft (20% victim rate claimed)
- **Typical Case:** Contract violations (promised 20hrs/week, forced to work 40+hrs with no pay increase), fake tax deductions, recruiter fraud
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Core value proposition. Verified listings, school vetting, contract transparency, and blacklist system can directly address this.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Warning Expats! Before you even send a resume to apply for any IB, Subject, Art, or Ennglish TEFL teaching job, spend 15 minutes at this sub or you WILL get cheated. I worked in China for 2 years. Trust me on this."
  2. "Teaching TEFL in Korea and China gives you a 20% chance of becoming an identity theft or 'silent scam' victim"
  3. "Your time teaching in China or Korea will either be fun and great or miserable depending on whether you get scammed or not. Its easy for new foreign teachers to fall into the trap of a dishonest recruiter or a blacklisted school that skims and deducts fakes taxes, and deposits."
  4. "MEDDEAS HORROR STORY... Meddeas is a scam, known for extorting young people... On my first day of work, the 'principal' of the school hits us with our schedule: 40+ hours a week, not including all the recess and lunch supervision shifts. No change in pay from my 900 euros a month."
  5. "Meddeas makes everyone attend a seminar, during which they really hammer that we should never ever bring up our 'contract,' or even say the word 'contract.' Apparently, 'this is bad manners to the Spaniards.'"

### 2. Untrustworthy Recruiters & Random DM Solicitations
- **Impact Score:** 9/10 - TRANSACTION BLOCKER
- **Funnel Stage:** During matching/application
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Teachers can't trust the intermediary facilitating the match
- **Why This Score:** Multiple posts show unsolicited recruiter DMs in comments, creating an environment of suspicion. Teachers asking "is this legitimate?" indicates transaction paralysis. Without trusted intermediary, matches can't complete even when jobs exist.
- **Evidence Count:** 4 posts with recruiter solicitations in comments, 3 posts asking if companies are legitimate
- **Worst Case:** Teachers pay deposits to fake recruiters, get placed in blacklisted schools
- **Typical Case:** Teachers waste time vetting recruiters, miss legitimate opportunities due to skepticism, or settle for subpar placements because they can't distinguish quality
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Platform becomes the trusted intermediary, eliminating need for individual recruiter vetting. Verified school badges and transparent reviews replace trust-in-recruiter model.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Hey man, I'm acting as an agent and I got a couple of gigs in Beijing... If you're keen DM me." (unsolicited comment on post about teaching with children)
  2. "Hey man, I'm acting as an agent, if you're still looking for a high paying teaching gig, let me know." (unsolicited comment on visa question)
  3. "ConversaSpain has sent me an acceptance letter, however, I am unsure that this is a legitimate company. There is quite a large fee and there is hardly any reviews. The only reviews I find seem fake"
  4. "Now my recruiters are kind of putting my head in a spin and I'm unsure about the exact documents I need for the next part in the process"
  5. "TEACHING NOMAD: Are they trustworthy and do you recommend the program?... Also want to make sure it's not a scam loll"

### 3. Visa Complexity & Documentation Confusion
- **Impact Score:** 8/10 - MID-FUNNEL CHURN
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-match & application process
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS/BLOCKS - Teachers abandon before completing application
- **Why This Score:** Multiple posts show teachers confused about visa requirements, document apostille processes, and timeline pressures. This creates abandonment during the application phase. Teachers who can't navigate visa complexity never reach the matching stage.
- **Evidence Count:** 4 posts explicitly about visa issues
- **Worst Case:** Teachers lose deposits because visa doesn't arrive in time, miss deadlines, or give up entirely
- **Typical Case:** Confusion about required documents, timeline stress, need to hire expensive expeditors
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Platform can provide clear documentation checklists, timeline guidance, and connect teachers with vetted visa services. Cannot eliminate visa complexity but can reduce friction significantly.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "The first hang up was the Visa process... The program accepts people too late to get a visa without expedition (a lot of $$$). I'm from CA, and got my visa approved only days before I was supposed to leave. It was a huge source of stress"
  2. "you lose this money if you leave the program for any reason, or if you do not get your visa in time"
  3. "I'm working on getting my China work Visa (Z) and I've gotten pretty far... Now my recruiters are kind of putting my head in a spin and I'm unsure about the exact documents I need for the next part in the process"
  4. "Does anyone know of a vendor that is reputable and will assist with the visa application process?"

### 4. Age Discrimination (Filtering Older Teachers)
- **Impact Score:** 8/10 - MID-FUNNEL CHURN
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform & search
- **Transaction Impact:** BLOCKS - Qualified teachers filtered out before matching
- **Why This Score:** Qualified teachers with decades of experience can't even enter the funnel. This represents lost revenue for platform and reduces marketplace liquidity. Teacher explicitly states "getting filtered out of a lot of job searches."
- **Evidence Count:** 1 detailed post, likely underreported due to shame/stigma
- **Worst Case:** Experienced 62-year-old with BEd, TESOL, extensive experience considers applying "locally and take my chances" because online filtering blocks them
- **Typical Case:** Age filters prevent qualified candidates from seeing opportunities or applying
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Platform policy decision. Can ban age-based filtering, highlight experience as asset, create "experienced teacher" category. Major differentiation opportunity.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I'm 62, Canadian, with a BEd, TESOL, lots of experience... I know my age is factor, I'm getting filtered out of a lot of job searches, ok, fair enough I guess. I'm thinking just to go there and applying locally and take my chances."

### 5. Family/Dependent Restrictions (Parents & Spouses Blocked)
- **Impact Score:** 8/10 - MID-FUNNEL CHURN
- **Funnel Stage:** Search & matching
- **Transaction Impact:** BLOCKS - Qualified teachers can't apply to most positions
- **Why This Score:** Teachers with families represent a significant qualified pool that can't complete transactions. One post notes "Most Asian schools won't hire you with that many dependents." This artificially restricts marketplace liquidity and blocks willing matches.
- **Evidence Count:** 3 posts about teaching with children/spouse
- **Worst Case:** Highly qualified PhD candidate with 7 years experience and strong credentials limited to small subset of schools
- **Typical Case:** Teachers with spouse/children find job search extremely difficult, rely on recruiter DMs (increasing scam risk), or give up
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Platform can create "family-friendly" filters and promote schools that accept dependents, but cannot force schools to change policies. Can improve discovery of available options.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Anyone know of schools abroad that offer teaching opportunities to teachers with children? I have a 4-year-old so I would need to work for a company that allows parents with children."
  2. "Most Asian schools won't hire you with that many dependents... In most schools, you won't be able to support a family of 4 on one salary."
  3. "I'm wondering what the reality of accepting a position in any country... and moving with a spouse looks like. How does a dependent visa work? Are there realistic ways they would be able to work or even have a life?"

### 6. Credential Confusion (License Types, Verification Complexity)
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE RISK
- **Funnel Stage:** During application/matching
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Creates uncertainty that delays or prevents matches
- **Why This Score:** Teachers don't know if their credentials are acceptable, leading to analysis paralysis and abandoned applications. Post shows teacher with multiple credentials uncertain which to pursue. This friction prevents otherwise good matches from completing.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 posts about credential confusion
- **Worst Case:** Teacher pursues wrong credential type, wastes time/money, credential not accepted by desired schools
- **Typical Case:** Teachers with valid credentials don't apply because they're unsure if they're "qualified enough"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Clear credential requirements per listing, credential verification service, FAQ about which licenses are accepted where. Reduces uncertainty in matching process.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I have two options for a teaching license from AZ-- one is subject matter expert 6-12 (English), and the other is the general ENG 6-12... if my previous employer doesn't verify me, should I just do subject matter expert? Will international schools in Japan accept that license?"
  2. "Did you find an answer to this? I'm looking at AZ's Subject Matter Expert certificate as well." (shows ongoing confusion)

### 7. Overwhelming Recruiter/Program Choice Paralysis
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE RISK / MID-FUNNEL SLOWDOWN
- **Funnel Stage:** Search & evaluation
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers spend excessive time researching instead of applying
- **Why This Score:** Multiple posts show teachers "overwhelmed" by number of options, unable to distinguish quality programs. This increases time-to-match and may result in poor decisions that damage platform reputation if facilitated through job board.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 posts explicitly about being overwhelmed by choices
- **Worst Case:** Teacher paralyzed by options, gives up, or chooses poorly and has bad experience
- **Typical Case:** Extended research period, reliance on Reddit recommendations, asking "which agency should I use?"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Curated listings, verified badges, transparent reviews, and comparison tools eliminate need to research dozens of agencies. Platform becomes the filter.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "There are so many agencies that I'm having a difficult time deciding which one to use to apply. I'm seeking information on what would be the best agency/recruiter to reach out to"
  2. "I've attempted to search, but unsuccessful with what I seek or just becoming overwhelmed"
  3. "everything that I am researching entails registering with a program with a high price tag... I'm just curious if this is all worth it"

### 8. Missing School-Specific Reviews/Experience Reports
- **Impact Score:** 6/10 - FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY
- **Funnel Stage:** Search & evaluation
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers can't evaluate opportunities efficiently
- **Why This Score:** Multiple posts asking "Does anyone have experience with [specific school/program]?" shows lack of centralized, trustworthy review infrastructure. This slows matching as teachers must research each opportunity through scattered Reddit posts/forums.
- **Evidence Count:** 3 posts asking for specific school experiences
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts position at problematic school because no reviews existed
- **Typical Case:** Extended vetting period, reliance on sparse Reddit responses (often no responses), uncertainty persists through decision
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Core platform feature. Verified reviews from past teachers, rating systems, structured feedback about specific schools/programs. Major competitive advantage.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Does anyone have experience working at Avalon Langcon English Asan? I have read many reviews about other Avalon Langcon locations but can't seem to find any reviews of this location"
  2. "Pioneers Baccalaureate Schools in Palestine – Any Insights?... I'd love to hear from anyone with experience or knowledge about the school"
  3. "TEACHING NOMAD: Are they trustworthy and do you recommend the program?... I don't see many reviews on them"

### 9. LGBT/Identity Documentation Issues
- **Impact Score:** 6/10 - FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform & search
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS/BLOCKS for specific demographic
- **Why This Score:** Teachers with non-binary or LGBT+ status face additional friction finding schools that will accept them. This reduces platform liquidity for this demographic. However, smaller total market size (compared to scam issue) makes it 6/10 rather than higher.
- **Evidence Count:** 1 post, likely underreported
- **Worst Case:** Qualified teacher with "X" passport gender marker cannot find any placements
- **Typical Case:** Extended search to identify LGBT-friendly schools, lack of clear information, uncertainty about visa/documentation acceptance
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Platform can add "LGBT-friendly" verified badges, create safe search filters, provide clarity on which schools/countries accept diverse identities. Improves matching for this segment.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Does anyone have any experience teaching abroad with an LGBT spouse? I am F on my passport and they are X. I want to see whether I could use my TEFL to get into a teaching program and bring them with me as a dependent. Does anyone know where this would not be an issue?"
  2. "Did you ever figure out where?" (no answer provided - shows information gap)

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### 1. **Deposit Loss Risk Creates Platform Avoidance**
Multiple posts mention programs requiring non-refundable deposits that are forfeited if visa doesn't arrive in time or candidate withdraws. This creates risk-aversion that may prevent teachers from using platforms that charge upfront fees. YouTeacher should consider NO upfront teacher fees - revenue from schools only.

**Quote:** "note the program requires a downpayment to hold your spot (they require more $$$ than other programs), and you lose this money if you leave the program for any reason, or if you do not get your visa in time"

### 2. **Contract Gaslighting ("Don't Mention Your Contract")**
The MEDDEAS case reveals sophisticated scam tactics where programs explicitly tell teachers not to discuss their contracts. This shows need for platform-level contract transparency and violation reporting.

**Quote:** "Meddeas makes everyone attend a seminar, during which they really hammer that we should never ever bring up our 'contract,' or even say the word 'contract.' Apparently, 'this is bad manners to the Spaniards.'"

### 3. **Career Trajectory Anxiety (Not Solving Immediate Job Match)**
Multiple posts show teachers worried about what comes AFTER teaching abroad - career progression, returning home, permanent residency paths. This is lower priority for job board business but indicates opportunity for content marketing and community features.

**Quote:** "I'm hoping that teaching abroad gives me a much-needed break from constant career anxiety and lets me pivot towards something else, but I do want to be realistic about the prospects of leaving the US for a year and then returning to build a career"

### 4. **Burnout as Primary Motivation**
Multiple posts cite burnout and "need for change" as primary driver to teach abroad. This suggests marketing messaging should emphasize lifestyle improvement, not just job matching.

**Quote:** "I'll be turning 30 this summer and have been feeling some serious feelings of burnout in my current lifestyle. All I keep thinking about is traveling"

---

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### 1. **Short-term Placement Availability (<6 months)**
- **Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher focused on legitimate long-term positions. Short-term "tourist teaching" often overlaps with visa violations and lower quality opportunities.
- **Quote:** "I'm looking to join a program that is 6 months or less. I plan to travel for a year"

### 2. **TEFL Certification Quality/Value Questions**
- **Why Out of Scope:** Platform is job board, not certification provider. Teachers arrive with or without certs. Can provide information but not solve certification issues.
- **Quote:** "those 'in-class' hours and instruction are pseudo teaching. You do pretend classes and what not"

### 3. **Homesickness & Emotional Adjustment**
- **Why Out of Scope:** Platform cannot solve emotional challenges of living abroad. This is post-match experience issue not related to job board functionality.
- **Quote:** "I have a feeling of bittersweetness of being away from home for another year and away from loved ones. Is this feeling normal or is it a red flag?"

### 4. **Specific Country Permanent Residency Paths**
- **Why Out of Scope:** Immigration policy beyond platform control. Can provide information as content but not solve through platform features.
- **Quote:** "Taiwan seems like the only one where permanent residence is actually possible... China basically seems impossible unless you marry in"

### 5. **Teaching License Bureaucracy (State-Level)**
- **Why Out of Scope:** Cannot change US state licensing requirements. Can only provide clarity about which licenses are accepted where.

## Key Insights for Product Development:

1. **Trust is Everything:** Nearly every high-impact pain point relates to trust. Teachers assume scams until proven otherwise.

2. **Verification = Value:** Platform must verify schools, contracts, and credentials. This is the core value proposition.

3. **Transparency Wins:** Teachers want to see real contracts, real reviews, real salary ranges. Hidden information = assumed scam.

4. **No Upfront Teacher Fees:** Risk-averse market. Revenue from schools, not teachers seeking jobs.

5. **Community Policing Works:** Teachers actively warn each other on Reddit. Platform needs similar community-driven trust mechanisms (reviews, blacklists, reports).

6. **Demographic Filters Matter:** Age, family status, and identity significantly impact who can match with which schools. Clear filtering reduces wasted time.
