# Pain Point Discovery Report - r/expats

## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Scam Recruiters & Fraudulent Job Offers
- **Impact Score:** 10/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Search
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops
- **Why This Score:** Scam recruiters selling fake degrees, false contract promises, and bait-and-switch tactics completely destroy platform trust. Teachers lose thousands of dollars and face visa/deportation issues. This is a platform killer - once burned by a scam recruiter, users will never trust job boards again. "I'll never use [platform] again" is the exact pattern we see.
- **Evidence Count:** 3+ detailed posts with extensive documentation
- **Worst Case:** Lost $4,439 (TEFL course + fake degree), ended up working illegally at half promised salary, discovered degree was fake when applying elsewhere, nearly arrested and deported
- **Typical Case:** Applied through recruiter, paid for courses/documents, arrived in country to find contract terms completely different or non-existent accommodation
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Core differentiation opportunity. Verification of legitimate schools, transparent contracts, no third-party recruiters taking cuts.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I lost my job because of COVID so I decided to go teach in Korea or Japan and started answer job ads online. I was warned to stay away from foreign job agents, so ended up talking to U.K. recruiter named Ian who told me he would guarantee me a job teaching in Japan that would pay me $4,500 a month, but since I have no degree or teaching experience, he said I had to take his $439 TEFL course in order to get the job... Five days before I was supposed to leave he told me to switch my ticket for Seoul, Korea... When I got to Korea, there was no apartment for me as promised... The principal was a nice lady who then told me I would start teaching on a probationary basis for the first 3 months and during this period I was an intern working at half salary which is NOT what my contract said... I called Ian, who said he would 'look into it' and call me back. Not only did he not call me back, but he blocked my number! Another teacher then told me I should go apply for work at one of the chain schools, but when I went to one they demanded to see my original degree and when I showed them the one that Ian sold me for $500 they [told me it was fake]"
  2. "Roughly 60% of the TEFL job ads you see online are linked to frauds. These are 'bait ads'... Made an account to ask this. I have applied for a job which almost seems a bit too good... The only thing that must be paid for is £250 towards the tenancy which will be reimbursed if nothing is damaged at the end of the tenancy (or so they say). Everything like plane flights (also supposedly reimbursed at the end of the 12 months) and visa payment (£150~) must also be paid by myself"
  3. "China is possible, but it looks risky with non-natives (visa issues, scams, shady contracts)"

### 2. Visa Complexity & Work Permit Barriers
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Matching
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops
- **Why This Score:** Teachers engage with listings and want to apply, but visa requirements are so complex and country-specific that transactions never complete. "I found a job but couldn't seal the deal" pattern. Users abandon the platform when they realize they can't legally work. High engagement, zero revenue.
- **Evidence Count:** 40+ posts mentioning visa confusion/barriers
- **Worst Case:** Teacher forced to leave country after 7 years when work permit cancelled, unable to return despite life built there (family, savings, career)
- **Typical Case:** Finds job posting, starts interview, discovers they need bachelor's degree/specific nationality/criminal background check with apostille from home country, abandons search
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Can provide clear visa requirement filters and guidance, but cannot change country laws. Could partner with visa services.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Do I need to get all 3 of my TEFL certificate, degree certificate AND acro police certificate legalized by both a solicitor AND by the Chinese embassy? And do I have to do this all on my own or would a potential employer assist in any of this?"
  2. "To 'teach' English in China you need minimum a bachelors and a TEFL certificate. To get an IT role you need some experience as China pumps out absolute shitloads of junior programmers each year"
  3. "Your best bet is to look for Chinese firms abroad or foreign firms that do business in China. Then send an email directly to whatever emails you can find... It'll take time and commitment"
  4. "The Chinese employer, hired someone already in Japan at the last minute. Now he was going to send me to a 'Hagwon' in Korea that only paid $3,000 a month! When I got to Korea, there was no apartment for me"
  5. "China just today locked down and isn't allowing any foreigners to enter the country, even those with valid residency visas"

### 3. Job Market Saturation & Competition ("Too Many Teachers")
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Application
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows significantly
- **Why This Score:** Teachers find listings but give up after weeks/months of applying with zero responses. Market oversaturation means even qualified candidates abandon platforms. High acquisition cost, low conversion. "I gave up searching after 2 weeks because I couldn't get a single interview."
- **Evidence Count:** 15+ posts
- **Worst Case:** Unemployed expat in Shanghai for 6 months after layoff, fluent in Chinese, strong portfolio, "had 1 interview... Most people don't hire foreigners in this time. Doesn't matter my language proficiency or my Portfolio"
- **Typical Case:** Applies to 50+ positions, gets 0-2 interviews, questions whether it's worth continuing
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Verification/vetting reduces noise, quality over quantity listings, better matching algorithms
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "It's 2 months, and I cannot find a decent job. I had 1 interview, for a job that would pay me half with the promise of a 996 life work balance, but in a remote city... That's all. Most people don't hire foreigners in this time. Doesn't matter my language proficiency or my Portfolio. They simply don't"
  2. "I'm not really in contact with many English teachers, so I was curious if anyone has felt a downturn in teaching job postings? I'm aware that there are likely less teaching jobs from people leaving the profession during COVID, but it feels like the ESL market is saturated at the moment for China"
  3. "The tech job market sucks generally. And getting a skilled worker visa anywhere decent given your current education and lack of experience, is going to be nigh on impossible"

### 4. Contract Violations & Broken Promises
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops future transactions
- **Why This Score:** Match happens successfully, but school violates contract (salary cuts, unpaid wages, housing not provided). Platform gets blamed, creates negative reviews, damages reputation long-term. Even if YouTeacher didn't cause it, teachers associate the platform with bad outcomes.
- **Evidence Count:** 8+ posts
- **Worst Case:** Boss cancelled work permit and fired teacher for teaching sitting down after injury, then didn't pay final salary, forcing teacher to flee country with "very little in savings"
- **Typical Case:** School reduces salary during probation period, doesn't provide promised housing allowance, changes working hours unilaterally
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Can verify schools, require escrow/payment guarantees, provide dispute resolution, but can't enforce contracts across borders
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "This year I broke my foot, and consequently lost my job as the boss would not accept me teaching sitting down. He also cancelled my work permit and residence card. I was forced out of Vietnam, and headed to Thailand, with very little in savings. Very little (last salary was also not paid)"
  2. "The principal was a nice lady who then told me I would start teaching on a probationary basis for the first 3 months and during this period I was an intern working at half salary which is NOT what my contract said. I protested and she told me I i didn't like it I should go look for another job!"
  3. "I was paid into an ICBC account and that money is still there. In February 2020 I returned to the US because of the COVID situation but I continued to work for the same company, teaching online. They switched their payments to my American account and I finished my contract with them on December 5th 2020. Since then I haven't received any financial documentation from this company"

### 5. Discrimination Based on Nationality/Race
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Application
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops specific user segments
- **Why This Score:** Entire demographic segments (non-native speakers, non-white teachers) are systematically excluded from job opportunities. Creates bad PR, limits market size. Users see discriminatory requirements and immediately churn. "This platform isn't for me."
- **Evidence Count:** 12+ posts
- **Worst Case:** Qualified Moroccan teacher with CELTA and 4+ years experience can't find work in Gulf/China: "most schools there want PGCE or licensed teachers. China is possible, but it looks risky with non-natives (visa issues, scams, shady contracts)"
- **Typical Case:** Job listings explicitly require "native speakers" or specific passport holders, qualified teachers from other countries can't even apply
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Can prohibit discriminatory listings, but many countries have legal requirements favoring certain nationalities for work visas
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I'm Moroccan, almost 30, currently living in South Korea... Teaching started as a part-time job during uni, but I ended up stuck with it for the past 6 years... Where can you legally live in work? How is the market for engineers there? People that go to Korea and Japan and teach often find themselves in this position and frustrated, desperate for a change in industry that is very difficult to pull off"
  2. "China is possible, but it looks risky with non-natives (visa issues, scams, shady contracts)"
  3. "So more than anything I'd really like to find a job as a photographer in China but teaching english or doing anything would be great... I assume by white guy job you mean a job you make bank for with relatively low skill/skill investment?"

### 6. Career Dead-End & Skills Trap
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match
- **Transaction Impact:** Damages long-term platform reputation
- **Why This Score:** Teachers get jobs successfully, but 2-3 years later realize they're stuck in ESL with no career progression. They blame platforms for not warning them. Creates negative sentiment that spreads to prospective users. Not an immediate transaction blocker but creates long-term churn and bad word-of-mouth.
- **Evidence Count:** 20+ posts
- **Worst Case:** 6 years teaching ESL, "stuck", can't transition to original field (engineering), "frustrated, desperate for a change in industry that is very difficult to pull off"
- **Typical Case:** After 3-4 years teaching, teachers want to transition to other careers but have no local experience, stuck on teaching visas
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Can provide career progression info, warn users upfront, offer transition resources
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I've been an ESL teacher in China for about 4 years... I'd like to get more qualifications or start planning now for a way to transition out of ESL... I'm not sure of what kinds of businesses send their employees to live remotely"
  2. "I'm Moroccan, almost 30... Teaching started as a part-time job during uni, but I ended up stuck with it for the past 6 years... desperate for a change in industry that is very difficult to pull off"
  3. "I am an American expat in China. And I've been teaching English for the past 4 years... I definitely don't want to go back to retail or work a service job. I just wonder what my prospects are"
  4. "I'm 27M, have yet to do anything like go to school (barely graduated high school) but now I'm starting to figure out what I want to do. I can't live off welfare my whole life!"

### 7. Geographic/Market Restrictions ("Can't Work Where I Want")
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows, reduces satisfaction
- **Why This Score:** Users want specific locations but can't find opportunities there, or listings are concentrated in undesirable locations (tier-3 cities vs tier-1). Leads to settling for suboptimal matches, lower satisfaction, eventual churn. Not a transaction blocker but reduces platform value.
- **Evidence Count:** 10+ posts
- **Worst Case:** Teacher wants to live in specific city (Taiwan, Thailand with good salary) but market doesn't support it: "I specifically wanted to go to Taiwan but ESL there is not very good, or Thailand but the salaries aren't very high"
- **Typical Case:** All good jobs are in cities users don't want to live in, or users want to live in specific cities but opportunities are limited there
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** NO - Market reality, but platform can set expectations clearly
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I've been an ESL teacher in China for about 4 years, not every country has opportunities for it, I specifically wanted to go to Taiwan but ESL there is not very good, or Thailand but the salaries aren't very high"
  2. "I had 1 interview, for a job that would pay me half with the promise of a 996 life work balance, but in a remote city... That's all"
  3. "We were working in China, but a return in the near future seems unlikely. We have an almost 4 year old and a 6 month old. We potentially have opportunities to move to either Vietnam, Cambodia, or Morocco"

### 8. Information Overload & Poor Search UX
- **Impact Score:** 6/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows matching
- **Why This Score:** Teachers find listings but search is so bad they can't efficiently filter, compare, or prioritize opportunities. Extends time-to-match significantly. Eventually find jobs but process is frustrating. Many competitors have terrible 1995-era UX (Dave's ESL Cafe).
- **Evidence Count:** Observed from framework context + 5 posts complaining about finding information
- **Worst Case:** User gives up after weeks of research because information is "contradictory or out of date"
- **Typical Case:** Spends hours searching multiple platforms, can't compare opportunities effectively, decision paralysis
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is core product differentiator. Modern UX, smart filters, comparison tools.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I'm wanting to relocate to (most likely) Southeast Asia and I've been researching it like crazy. However, the internet is full of contradictory or out of date information regarding cost of living, safety, and other issues... I can't seem to narrow down my options, and more and more research isn't narrowing things down for me at all"
  2. "I have been looking on the job market and found a rather exciting opportunity teaching English in China- no experience required, no teaching certificate required... I understand that this would be an obvious scam if they ask me for some money... The only thing that must be paid for is £250 towards the tenancy"
  3. "Does anyone have any advice about any good job board or recruitment agencies that specialize in hiring foreigners in Europe or Canada?"

### 9. Cost of Living vs Salary Mismatch
- **Impact Score:** 6/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-application
- **Transaction Impact:** Reduces application rates
- **Why This Score:** Teachers see listings but don't apply because salary doesn't justify cost of living in that location. Reduces conversion but doesn't stop transactions entirely. Users will apply to higher-value opportunities.
- **Evidence Count:** 12+ posts discussing salary/COL calculations
- **Worst Case:** "I'm from New York... living in Japan... with a 60 hour workweek in the USA to a government regulated 38 hour work week in Denmark…. The whole time felt like vacation [but] SK is rapidly turning into Japan in terms of tefl. China is a shit show... Taiwan's cheaper, but the salaries aren't amazing"
- **Typical Case:** Teachers calculate they can save more in China tier-2 city vs Japan tier-1 city despite Japan paying more
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Transparent salary info + cost of living calculators, savings potential estimates
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Looking to teach English in SK or China for a year. Which country will allow me to save more money? Considering salary, cost of living, etc."
  2. "Currently teaching English in Russia but not feeling the vibe of the country. Plus I am unable to save money and struggle to get by since Moscow is very expensive"
  3. "How much can you realistically save in China if that is your goal?... 15000 RMB+ would be ideal for me to save every month but 10000 RMB would be the bare minimum I would want to save"

### 10. Regulatory/Policy Changes (e.g., China ESL Crackdown)
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (retention)
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops existing users, scares new users
- **Why This Score:** Government policy changes (China cracking down on foreign teachers, COVID restrictions) instantly make entire markets unavailable. Existing teachers lose jobs, prospective teachers avoid the market. Creates platform instability - users fear making commitments. While YouTeacher can't prevent this, it severely damages the market.
- **Evidence Count:** 8+ posts
- **Worst Case:** "A couple of years ago there were regulatory changes that killed the ESL industry where I am (China) and ever since I've lived under a small cloud of anxiety about what I'll do for work"
- **Typical Case:** Teachers avoid China market entirely due to uncertainty: "Didn't they recently make privat English schools illegal? I would check up on this before accepting any offers"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** NO - Cannot control government policy, but can provide early warnings, help teachers diversify
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Just curious what long-term expats who are married and have families with a local wife or husband have as your safety nets? I always kept English teaching in my back pocket as my emergency back-up job that would cover the bills, but a couple of years ago there were regulatory changes that killed the ESL industry where I am (China)"
  2. "I'm making about $80k a year which puts you safely in the middle class in China. However the government is getting more and more nationalistic and trying to remove 'foreign influence' from education. We think in 5-10 years they will kick all non Chinese out of education all together"
  3. "Didn't they recently make privat English schools illegal? I would check up on this before accepting any offers that isn't from the Chinese government"
  4. "If you are wondering, China did not allow people with valid work permits or spousal visas to return to China for the last 2,5 years. People didn't see their families during this time. Some lost their businesses"

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### Financial Services Barriers
Multiple teachers struggle with basic financial operations that prevent them from considering or completing job applications:
- Cannot easily transfer money out of China ("you need to get you personal income tax receipts from the tax office... Then take tax receipts to your bank")
- Cannot check bank balances from abroad ("I am unable to check my account balance from abroad as I am not a chinese national")
- Student loan payments from abroad are complicated
- No clear guidance on tax obligations when working abroad

**Business Impact:** Pre-match barrier. Teachers hesitate to apply for international positions if they can't figure out how to handle money/loans/taxes.

### Reverse Culture Shock & Homesickness
Significant pain point often leads teachers to leave positions early or avoid returning to countries:
- "I (27M) just got back to the US (Chicago) a few months ago from teaching in China. I loved my time abroad, but wanted to come back... The move to a new city isn't as exciting as I thought it would be"
- "My Chinese girlfriend living in the united states is terribly homesick... She hasn't seen her family or friends in China in four years"
- "Since then, I have been struggling a lot and feel like I am a foreigner [returning to China from UK]. Everyday i experience so much reverse culture shock"

**Business Impact:** Post-match retention issue. Teachers leave jobs early, creating negative reviews and higher churn.

### Partner/Family Visa Complications
Teachers find jobs but can't bring partners/spouses because:
- Not married yet
- Partner can't get dependent visa
- Partner can't work on dependent visa
- This blocks entire demographic from applying

**Business Impact:** Transaction blocker for partnered individuals, reduces addressable market.

### Career Advice Gap
Teachers don't just want jobs, they want career guidance:
- "What should I do back in Murica... I can't say I have any skills or talents or anything to set me apart from others"
- "I'm thinking about my possible opportunities back home in the long run. I'm from New York... I'm not too sure whether I want to go back to New York. I can't say I have any skills or talents"

**Business Impact:** Opportunity for YouTeacher to add career counseling/planning features as premium service.

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### Work-Life Balance & Burnout ("996 culture")
- **Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher cannot control school working conditions, only report them
- **Evidence:** "My first job really humbled me a lot, but living a frugal life like never before made me more tough... I think I survived 2 years in a 11 11 6 more than a 996"
- **Note:** Can provide transparency through school reviews

### Cultural Adjustment & Loneliness
- **Why Out of Scope:** Personal psychological challenges, not job board issue
- **Evidence:** "The first year I was in China post-college was the loneliest year of my life and was extremely stressful"
- **Note:** Could provide community features to mitigate

### Geopolitical Tensions (US-China relations)
- **Why Out of Scope:** Cannot control international relations
- **Evidence:** "Increasing tensions between China and the U.S. also make me slightly nervous being an expat here"
- **Note:** Can provide safety updates/alerts

### Healthcare & Insurance Complexity
- **Why Out of Scope:** Country-specific systems, YouTeacher can only provide information
- **Evidence:** Multiple posts about Medicare, Chinese healthcare, insurance coverage
- **Note:** Could partner with insurance providers

### Language Barriers (Learning Local Language)
- **Why Out of Scope:** Personal skill development, not platform issue
- **Evidence:** Teachers struggle with Chinese/Korean/Japanese language learning
- **Note:** Could provide language learning resources as partnership

### Social Integration & Friendship
- **Why Out of Scope:** Personal social life, not job matching
- **Evidence:** "It gets tiring doing the 'making friends' thing over and over again when you know they are almost certainly going to leave in a year or two"
- **Note:** Could build expat community features

### Relationship Strain (Long Distance)
- **Why Out of Scope:** Personal relationship issues
- **Evidence:** "me and my partner are currently working in the US on OPT visa in different cities... we have three more chances in the lottery... I have the constant anxiety about my partner's 'sacrifice'"
