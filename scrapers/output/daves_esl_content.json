I'm so confused on all of this - it seems there is more infor about L and F visa's and the need for a Z visa then there is once you have one.\n\nThe warning about Shanghai BSK Academy has this too: They never gave any of their employees a Foreign Expert Certificate book. The ex roomie had to meet an official from the company to go to the bank, where they would bring the booklet then take it back again. I never even saw mine. When I was let go I was told I couldn't have it and that it was sent back to the bureau.\n\nI tried to get an extension today but was told I need that certificate. I have a letter from the new school I work for, however I have no contract with them. I was told that with my release letter (required from your previous employer to be legal to work for a new one) would get me one month extension, but that I need the expert cert for a longer term. I don't know what the one month extension includes - multiple entry or not?\n\nThe new school will not apply for all the necessary paperwork I'm sure. They hire foreign freelancers, and I'm sure that would cause problems. I know the warnings about shady situations and it's not shady if my visa is in order, it's just not a place to get my visa in order. A very common occurrence here.\n\nSo, does anyone have experience in this situation? Have you extended your Z visa on your own? I need to get to india next month and now time is running out. That old company, Pacican, should have given me the book or cancelled my visa. They didn't act within the law for this and now I'm in trouble too. Well, maybe not trouble; but for sure difficulty!",

In middle school they're a lot better in my experience, as they'd have to to be I suppose.\n\nAnother downside to primary school is that they don't have a lot of exams, activities or day trips so you may be teaching right up until the end of the semester while other foreigners you know at middle/high schools might get an extra week or two of holidays in winter and summer. At my middle school they also have a week of military training in October and they have monthly exams where I get a day off. It all adds up and a few extra days off can really refresh the batteries.",

        "content": "Like many people, I found myself in a situation this year of needing authenticated documents when I moved from Nanjing to Shanghai. Due to the fact that my residence permit was soon expiring and my oh so lovely school is clueless about the new regulations, I had to go to Hong Kong and get a tourist visa temporarily while I waited for my documents (the school paid hehe). Here are the steps I took to get my documents without going home. I'm hoping this will be of some use to others who have some questions. This is for US citizens by they way...\n\nDiploma:\n\nThis process took about 3 months for me to complete. The first step is to obtain a notarized copy of your diploma. How is that possible if you aren’t at home and able to go to the notary and a notarization in China won’t work? Well, you can have the school registrar notarize it for you instead. This was the step I had to take. This process took the most time because, in order to get the notarized copy (the school refers to it as an apostille), I had to order a new diploma. It took 6 weeks for that to be delivered to the school. The registrar’s office then had to make a copy of it, put the required statement on the back, and notarize it. With mailing time, the total time was 7 weeks. Your school may be different with mailing times in this regard. In fact, you should contact your school beforehand to see if there is a way to shorten the process because if you have someone bring your diploma in person for you, it is likely they will do it on the spot. After I received it back, I had to send it to the Secretary of State to be apostilled. Certain states may require further authentication with the USDS. Luckily, I didn’t need to take this step because my diploma is from Texas. It took about 2-3 weeks for me to receive my apostilled diploma back from the Secretary of State. Once you receive it back, it can be sent to the Chinese Embassy or Consulate for authentication. For this, I chose CVSC because their prices were good a",

It's possible if you have a few hundred US dollars to blow for consular fees *and* waiting around some additional days which a local Chinese consulate takes - among other things.\n\nNeither the school nor the consular desk in Hanoi seems to know exactly how long the wait would be altogether though. The nice lady on the phone said a few days normally plus apparently, another few days or a week just because there's a new apostille to verify and doing that \"depends on my boss\" somehow... And sometimes you may also have days of wait just to get inside some of the US or Viet offices involved to get the apostille in the first place.\n\nAll of this assumes your previous employer is nice enough to be very responsive and promptly send you documents you need from China (or wherever) to apply anyway. Or that some prospective employer might be interested enough to pick up a phone and call them in Chinese and give them a little nudge, rather than having teachers show up late or not at all because they got tired or could not afford all this uncertainty. You would suppose? Cough, cough. \"Yeah right\" in some cases.",

However, now that the US consulate has reopened after a long hiatus, they say 1) Vietnam is not part of the apostille system at all -- at least \"not yet\" -- and 2) American documents for US in China have to be apostilled IN China or else perhaps done through Authentications (not apostilles) in the US.

I'm from the U.K.\n\nMy first job in China was in a university, and it was NOT in a popular or trendy area. So I decided to check it out, by getting information from westerners who taught there. I decided to go, and it was not a mistake. I enjoyed teaching there. But this was not in Beijing. It was in the provinces, and there was a lot less of McDonalds and stuff like that. It was the real CHINA. I was happy but some people were not! I came with realistic expectations.

Thankfully you said what you've got in terms of paper work (which kind of helps, but the most important thing is your ability to try and sniff out good/bad work).\n\nWhen I was first in China I was here to study Chinese and all of that jazz and dealt with a recruiter and was only taking in a very humble 4800RMB. I just had fun and thought I was going to find privates easily, which was actually not possible. The area I had lived in was filled with the non-rich folk, and there were no training schools around even. They paid for all of my bills and everything, but still.. 4800RMB 5 years ago or so was not very good. I saved probably about 2000 or so of it, so that would be about 25000RMB a year, which is probably what you can save in a month here if you work a ton. Worst part of it all was on my way out my school couldn't realize why they couldn't keep a foreign teacher there. They paid a lot (and I didn't even know), and they couldn't retain a foreign teacher. I tried to explain to the school that I would stay if they got rid of the recruiter and paid me the full amount, but they were too hesitant and just believed us foreigners were unreliable and therefore the recruiter is a necessary evil (I hope they enjoy the 1-semester teachers).\n\nA year or so later I worked at a training school and took in a much healthier amount. I was at about 10,000RMB, however instead of working only 15 hours a week I had to work 20 now, and the hours were never blocked together. Training schools are fair in the sense that they will pay you on time, but everything else is out of the window. Endless antics from your uneducated bosses/colleagues and then there are the foreign narcs (usually super unqualified for work anywhere else and are looking to move up the chain there). With all of the shenanigans like the school not giving us proper time off, to starting to deduct people for not having \"p",

If you are content not living in the city center you will be fine. Public transportation is fantastic here, there's a Metro station every 10-15minutes walk. )\nTry and go for the type of job (public/'international' school) that Markness suggested. Most of these will come with an accomodation allowance (tax free). I get 3500/month and my rent is 3200/month (decent sized one bedroom apartment).\nYou can live very comfortably on 6k/month here, so if you have a job 12k+ you can easily save half of your salary (much more if you're a bit more frugal than I am haha).\nI'm three years in the same public school job (my first in China) and get a pay rise annually and full Summer pay upon re-signing of contract. I also get 8k airfare allowance in cash every Summer.\nSo I would say look for a minimum of 12k + good overall package and you will be fine in a Tier 1 city.\nI would be happy to answer any questions that you may have regarding the cost of living in SH etc, if it's of interst to you.\nAnyway, I hope that you can land on your feet as I have.

They said their other part-time, foreign teachers have a work visa from their full-time-job company. The person that inverviewed me knows that I'm on a tourist visa and wants to sign a contract with me next week. She says she'll look into getting me a visa but it's not likely.\n\nThe situation is this: I'll leave the country and come back this week, so I'll then have another 90 days on the second entry of my tourist visa. I'd like to find a job--teaching or otherwise--before the visa runs out in early June. My money situation is not bad; I have money in the bank but I'd rather start earning some money right away. So should I just forget about this part-time job and find something else? Thanks.",

Last place in China where I lived many foreign teachers didn't try to hide the fact that they were missionaries. They were a real asset to the city and no local official would have any incentive to get rid of them.\n\nComparisons to other countries are difficult. This is way off topic, but in the US there isn't a huge effort to crack down on illegal workers. The illegal worker uses someone else's social security number and no one in the government checks to make sure that the name of the worker matches the name assigned to that number...or how someone could be working in two places at once. The employer gets in trouble the most. If you're on a tourist visa and get paid in cash no one will find out you're working illegally...but that should go for China as well.\n\nI don't think an American would be sent to a Chinese prison and have to eat cockroaches or something, but would probably face deportation.",

Sure you can get away with it and some do for many years, but its not until something bad happens that you find how important it is to have been working legally. If you are the victim of a crime, an unscrupulous employer, an accident etc. you may find that you are deported quicker than you can resolve those issues, and if you have a relationship with a local or even just a nice little set up for yourself, it may become more and more difficult over time to have that yanked away from you.",

I'm including myself in that category after the year I've had with contract disputes.\nIt seems that quite often when a post is made regarding contractual obligations or specifics the poster is regaled by questions and comments like \"Didn't you read your contract?\" \"Why didn't you have it written into your contract?\", \"Why did you agree to that?\"etc.\n\nThe simple truth is that people coming out of the starters gate very often don't know the right questions to ask or what should be included that perhaps isn't.\nSo I'm wondering if a sticky that deals solely with contracts might be worthwhile. A place where people can copy and paste the contracts they have been offered and allow fellow forum members to help them avoid future problems by sharing some of the afore mentioned experience and expertise.\n\nWhat do you think??",

Of course, things are going to vary from school to school, so these would really be words of advice and the reader can take it or leave it.\n\nFor example:\n\nMost schools offer a furnished apartment. It would be advisable to ask your prospective employer exactly what the furnishings would be (a checklist, if you will).\nMost schools will also pay part or all of your utilities. These may include: water, drinking water, propane, electricity, internet, cable TV, phone. It would be advisable for you to check exactly how much of these items they will pay: 100%, 50%??\n\nMost schools probably won't give you a solid, set schedule until the day you start teaching. However, it's not too much to ask:\n\nThe maximum teaching hours that are expected of you (sometimes known as \"contact hours\") per week\nWill you work evenings, weekends, holidays?\nWhat will be the maximum number of students per class?\nWhat will be the teaching materials you will be using? Can they send you a sample unit? (Not too hard to do in this age of scanners, fax machines, copy machines, express mail, etc.)\nWhat facilities will you have in your classroom and/or office?\nCan they send you a list of things that may prove useful or helpful (such as magazines and other visual aids)?\n\nNot all of the above would be listed in a contract.

I think it is not too out there to have a school put together a check-list of what they offer so a future FT will not be blindsided upon arrival. If they can't or won't provide one, then submitting your own should be perfectly acceptable. If they do provide one and their list is slightly (or even majorly) different than the one you have in mind, that is where the negotiations come in (for example, a bicycle would not be an issue with me, but perhaps it would be for some FTs).\n\nAgain, a list like this should be preluded with something like:\n\n\"This is what I would want before accepting a position, how about you?\"\nor\n\"This is a general list of what most schools should be expected to provide.\"\n\n. . . because a sticky like this would be more of an advice sticky rather than a \"you MUST\" sticky.",

It's stressful but I managed to get it done in six nonstop hours of running around, even with mistakes and return trips... if the closest immigration center isn't nearby, prepare for some serious rage.\n\nSo basically you need to get a reference letter from your employer, and they might also have to certify copies of your passport and visas, and provide a copy of their business license. The first time I did it I only needed a reference letter but the second time I needed the other crap... so requirements might be arbitrary and prepare for a return trip and more demands if the officer is in a bad mood. And if your school administration people aren't the best prepare for a nightmare of back and forth trips... even my school's fully competent and obliging admin didn't know WTF was going on.\n\nSo you take the paperwork from your school to the immigration office and there will be officers there who will do what they do and assuming everything is ok, hand you a piece of paper with a stamp. You then take that paper to the police station that deals with the area where you live (I think)... it won't necessarily be closest to where you live. I honestly don't know what was special about the place I went to, but sufficed to say it wasn't just a random police station. I found it by asking at another police station. Maybe it had a special foreign crimes department? It's all a blur now, but the office they took me to had English on the door. You of course need to bring your passport.\n\nThese officers will give you yet ANOTHER piece of paper that's almost the same as the one from immigration.

This forum is a ghost town but if someone is looking for answers one day they might appreciate this story. I think most cities don't require a Chinese Criminal Check, but I needed one.. and schools are way less helpful when you are leaving than when you're starting, so you'll probably have to do this alone.\n\nThis is also possibly the most frustrating part of any visa process I have ever gone through in 7 different countries and 16 years of teaching abroad. Every step of the way the rules are uncertain, even your handlers won't necessarily understand it, and every place you go to takes what they need without giving it back, meaning if you or someone else makes a mistake at any stage in this complicated process, you have to do it all over again (UNLESS YOU TAKE PHOTOS). Also, the immigration people in the city to which you're moving will not provide an example of what they want before you submit your visa transfer application... so try to be as thorough as you possibly can.\n\nHere goes:\n\n\n0. TAKE PHOTOS OF EVERYTHING. At each stage they will take what they need and you will not get it back. Taking photos means if something goes wrong, you can use the photos to skip steps later on... and if your Chinese isn't great they will help you explain what you need later. They won't actually accept the photos, but you can use the camscanner app to turn them into scans and they'll accept printouts of the scans.\n\n1. AT YOUR SCHOOL: get a reference letter regarding your behavior at school. You also need a copy of the school's business license and school-stamped copies of your passport and residence permits. You also need another reference letter addressed to the notary public you need to see in step 4, and it's best to get it now. Take photos of everything (or get extra c",

Fair enough, but now the lockdown is easing and businesses are starting again, they no longer have that excuse. They have also told me to look for new work as they don't know if they'll reopen.\n\nI've asked them for it a couple of times, now theyre not responding to messages.\n\nSo whats the best course of action? Get a lawyer? I don't wanna piss them off though cos I will need a release letter to work elsewhere.\n\nThanks",

Some parents wanted them to go back, probably just tired of the kids at home, others said there is no point of going back for a month. There are no foreign teachers in the school, but this is something that is taking place around the country.\n\nI feel it is quite dangerous not being asked to return yet, if you rely on a job here. If they made it this long without you, then they have to be considering cutting that cost all together. This would include salary as well as any end of contract benefits. Most contracts have an out for unforeseen issues. On the flip side of that many schools are now out teachers. Weird market out there, and it seems impossible for new teachers to get the paperwork to come over.

This is in Shandong Province.\n\nI also talked to a recruiter friend and he said that most schools are not hiring from overseas for the same reasons. If you're in-country it's no problem.\n\nI called the Chinese Consulate here in the US and they told me that all Residence Permits are \"temporarily\" cancelled. Mine doesn't expire until the end of July but it's essentially voided. The Consulate also told me that all travelers from outside the country must undergo a two week quarantine on arrival, regardless of nationality. She said nothing about having to have a C-19 test for boarding.\n\nI was very fortunate that my school honored my contract and paid me in full every month during this school term. I taught my classes online but really only half the hours because they combined classes. They told me last week that my final payout (salary + bonus + airfare) would be July 15.\n\nSome of my classes returned to the school last month and they are telling me that the rules are unbearable. They can't even leave the campus, at all. It doesn't sound like a good place to be right now.\n\nI imagine that this is the end of the era where China was a good place to make easy money and live a decent and interesting lifestyle. I had a good 10-year run there and will miss it, but there are opportunities elsewhere.\n\nTo anyone who is thinking about going to China to work for the first time I would recommend against it.

Fewer and fewer people are willing to jump through all the BS hoops and wait for months just to work in China legally. The waiving of the age limit in some provinces is an obvious backlash to the central government's excessive regulations.",

OR the school simply lied to the 59 year old teacher and didn't want to renew her (Although I doubt this knowing the teacher and her relationship with the school).

Also, the Middle East has implemented a strict age policy under 59 which doesn't leave many other \"lucrative\" choices in the world. European countries require an EU passport and most often, they have highly qualified natives who can teach English.\n\nI taught in China long ago and it is definitely a crapshoot!

The problem is that they contact you and it is difficult to tell that they are flaky recruiters and not administrators or HR employees working for a specific school. So essentially you think a school is really interested in you, and it turns out that your wonderful hiring school contact is just a recruiter and has no decision making in the hiring process at all. These recruiters will not let you know or in any way let on to the fact that they are recruiters.\n\nAt some point teachers are going to realize that the ESL industry is in it's death throes. The above is one good example. It used to be that when a recruiter contacted you they had already sorted the hiring out with the school. Not anymore. It is now a Hansel and Gretel situation with these recruiters. There are now recruiter flakes breaking into online teaching possibilities. The online company that you think is interested in your potential as an online teacher turns out to be nothing but a recruiter rounding up individual students.",

I'm fine with working in a smaller (tier 2 or 3?) city, but my question is this: assuming you make the typical university salary of about 6000 rmb, how easy is it to get privates to supplement that income and what is a typical cost of living for a smaller city? For reference as to \"typical,\" I live in Seoul currently and save about half of my salary of 2.3 million won. I cook at home 5 nights a week and enjoy beer and pizza a few times a month.\n\nAnd since someone always asks, my qualifications are a bachelor's degree in English, a state teaching certificate from the US, and a few years teaching English language arts in the US. I realize most will say to work for an international school, but i REALLY prefer having more free time over more money.",

        "content": "Your privates will find you. If you prove to be an effective teacher, if you work at a public university or school, your FAO will put you in touch with people who need your services. Advertising for privates isn't a good idea simply for the fact that you may run afoul of the law if your FAO doesn't know about your extracurricular activities. If you make friends with adult Chinese, you'll eventually be asked to tutor their kids.\n\nIn a tier 2 or 3 city, you'll actually be able to save money on the standard pay. I wouldn't expect 6000rmb per month for a BA in a tier 2 or 3 public university, though. Count on 5000-5500rmb per month. That's still a livable wage that will allow you to save. Just be sure that utilities are paid and that your apartment is provided free and that it is PRIVATE.\n\nAnother thing to ask about is if you will live at one campus but teach at another. If you find this to be the case, decline the offer. The extra commute time is horrible (no matter how close the other campus is), especially if you have morning classes and afternoon classes at the second location. The school may tell you that it's just a short bike ride to the other campus and even provide you with a bike. Been there. Done that. A mile in freezing rain is a drag by bike, and standing in crummy winter weather waiting for a bus that may or may not arrive is not much better.\n\nSomething to make clear to your prospective employer is that you will expect to be able to save money at a bank, convert currency, and send some of it home. Though some here will swear up and down that you won't need help doing this, the truth is that unless your employer pays your income taxes, you will have a very difficult time doing much more than depositing and withdrawing money from your bank account. Been there, done that too.",

So far age restrictions are <60 for B and <65 for A work permit. Most language teachers are B. A is for higher qualifications as indicated by job position and pay. Only exceptions at higher pay levels within the A work permit.\n\nFrom December 2019 to December 2020, there is a trial period for a C type work permit for eligible Universities/companies located in the free trade zone, within SIP in Suzhou, Jiangsu. For the C type work permit, the age restriction is waived. For Master and Phd, the 2 years teaching experience requirement is also waived. With BS/BA you qualify with 10 years work experience, which is not restricted to teaching. My University Xi’an Jiaotong Liverpool University is eligible to apply for C residence permits.\n\nI have no idea where else this applies and what will happen after December of 2020.\n\nTo reiterate, with any work permit, you are only authorized to work at the place that has gotten you the work permit and only for the work you are authorized for. Any other work at any other place, or private teaching, will get you arrested, put in jail and deported. Also, if you are hired as an English teacher, you can teach only English, and not for instance French. Locally the police have a monthly quota of foreigners to fill, so they are actively looking for illegal work.\n\nCheers, Jean",

I teach AP and if an AP teacher switched mid-year it would lead to a very disconnected curriculum for the course. The place I work has us decide if we will return the following fall before the spring festival so that they can start work on filling any vacancies. In the three years I have been here I have not seen a mid year switch of any teachers. In the fall some teachers miss a few weeks sorting out paperwork.\n\nPreviously, I worked at a university for nine year, and mid year switch did happen. However, they did not require certification and did not pay accordingly either.\n\nOP: What subject are you certified to teach?",

I am posting my experiences here, as Peizheng College is a big recruiter of foreign teachers, and regularly advertises on this website.\n\nThe main problems I had concerned teaching hours, a deposit I was asked to pay for my apartment, and health problems at the campus which I was not told about.\n\nFirstly, after I arrived there, the college wanted to change my contract and tried to increase my teaching hours (but for the same salary - no corresponding increase in salary!).\n\nThe college seemed to think that changing already agreed contracts wasn’t a problem.\n\nSecondly, the college also tried to increase (by 100%!) the “deposit” I should pay for the apartment I would have lived in. The college staff pressed me to pay this much higher deposit immediately in cash, despite my employment contract saying my apartment deposit was due to be paid after I had received my first month’s pay.\n\nAlso, I encountered health problems at the campus which I was not informed about before travelling there. In the days before I arrived, the area around the college had an outbreak of the “nanovirus”. Local health authorities investigated the outbreak and closed the campus for 1 week.\n\nIf I had known in advance about these problems, I would have reviewed my travel and working arrangements to reconsider when, or if, I would travel to this college. However, as the college had not informed me of any of this, I felt my health and wellbeing were put at significant risk.\n\nGiven these problems, I departed Peizheng College within 1 week of my arrival. And based on my experiences there, I do not recommend this college to any teacher seeking employment.",

You get the 3000 deposit back at the end of the contract, assuming you didn't trash the apartment.\n\nIf you don't have 3000 yuan to spare up front, the contract says you can REQUEST a one month deferment. If your deferment is approved, your deposit is taken out of your first month's salary. If you opt for a deferment, the deposit goes up to 4000 yuan.\n\nIf you want to move into the foreign teachers dorm in January, the deposit goes up to 8000 yuan, 4000 for January and 4000 for February.\n\nTheir reasoning is that your contract doesn't begin til March, thus you are not yet an employee of the the school, thus you are essentially a guest and essentially using the dorm as a defacto hotel. Also, they have yet to observe your behavior and no one from the FAO's office will be there during that period to supervise you.\n\nIn March, you get 5000 yuan of your deposit back, then 3000 at the end of the contract. Not sure if they will let you move in in February, since the FAO's office is closed during the Spring Festival/winter break.\n\nAt the end of your contract, they will withhold 1000 yuan from your last month's salary to cover your last utility bill. They direct deposit the remainder into your bank account after they have paid the utility bill.\n\nI question the wisdom of putting 8000 yuan into the custody of a virtual stranger who will soon close up shop and disappear to their hometown for 6 weeks. If you have an emergency, you would have to talk her into returning to the campus. Presumably, she would have to convince the FAO director to return and sign off on the refund.",

After successful interview(s), I send the potential school:\nnew check/degree (legalised by Chinese Embassy)\nletters of previous work experience (references and end-of-service)\nmedical\n2. The school prepares resume and docs, then applies for an invitation letter at the provincial foreign affairs office.\n3. Once issued, the school sends it and we apply for a new Z Visa at the Chinese Embassy. Get on a plane.\n\nMy question is about the provincial foreign affairs office(s). Does anyone have direct knowledge: Are they connected?\n\nI was at a school in Beijing for 6 months. We mutually ended the agreement for “reasons.”\nI transferred my permits (work/residence) to Tianjin. I am about to finish a 12 month contract. I would stay but their international program is closing.\n\nWhen I interview, some are concerned and inquire about “hopping around.”\nI briefly explain first school “not a good fit,” second school “would stay but program closing.” My work experience before China is rather solid (2-4 years at each different school).\n\nSo … I would like to remove the Beijing school from my resume, basically add it together with experience from Tianjin and move forward as a stronger candidate.\n(Self-righteous Ethics Committee Members lurking about need not chime in).\n\nYet, I do not know if a foreign affairs office in a new province would have record of my 6 months at a school in Beijing. I wouldn’t want the new HR to meet with a hang up because that was not on the resume.\n\nIf indications are no, then I would combine work experience in Beijing to Tianjin and that’s it.\nIf indications are yes",

Then, ask them if they would allow a family member to collect the new notarized diploma.\n\nIf not, then see if they would allow a family member to collect it with a power of attorney or by signing some type of authorization with the university. That could be a whole other set of issues by itself.\n\nIf your university does not notarize diplomas, then investigate an e-notary. I found an e-notary at: www.notarycam.com/legal/. I have never used it, but it seems legit.\n\nTo e-notarize the document, you would need to create an electronic copy. When I ordered my two new diplomas, I immediately scanned a high quality copy on my computer.\n\nBefore you do anything, visit Visarite: http://www.visarite.com/auth_diploma.htm\n\nI'm not referring you to their services; but rather, I'm pointing you in the direction of an outlined process that worked for me. It clarifies what you need to do.\n\nBefore you send a diploma to a courier service, it must be notarized and authenticated by your secretary of state. They outline these steps (I used their checklist for reference, even though I did not use their service).\n\nBasically, if your university does not notarize diplomas, you must type, print on (by putting your diploma in a printer), or alter your diploma electronically with the something like this (in a blank area that is large enough to hold the text):\n\n\"I, (signature), declare this (the attached) is (my true original diploma) or (a true, exact and unaltered photocopy of my diploma)\".\n\nThe statement should be signed in presence of the notary (maybe an e-notary).

We're not Chinese, and they naturally want native speakers to teach their kids.\n\n2. In the teaching profession, in China, there are very few, if any, who don't welcome retirement at 55-60 or whatever. They can retire and make much more money running a private training school. I've known teachers who just quit their job in their 40s and opened a school and quite suddenly bought BMWs and started their international travel hobby.\n\n3. China has begun a crackdown on foreigners to weed out the undesirables, and you can be sure that most of these are young, marginally qualified backpackers who like to smoke a joint and play games or movies in class. I don't see that crackdown as a bad thing, but at the same time their new policies are making it harder for experienced teachers who have a little age on them to qualify. They can't have their cake and eat it too.\n\n4. The assumed \"prime years\" for professionals are age 30-50. Good luck recruiting these people in China. They will work the hard hours and make the big bucks in the West. The career projection for a young, well educated professional does not include teaching English in China.\n\n5. China has chosen to eliminate the margins, the irresponsible youth and the experienced but \"too old\" teachers. In the former it's good policy, in the latter they're cutting off their most valuable source of good education. Of course I say this knowing that there are both good and bad teachers all along the age spectrum.\n\n6. Chinese government policies toward Western workers, at every level, is politically motivated. They will get from us what they can, when they need it, and after our usefulness is perceived to be gone then we also will be gone. You can argue this point, but we're seeing it happen as we speak.\n\nI've loved my 9+ years here and hope to have more, but 'the times, they are a' chan",

We moved to Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia to work for a school with a foreign owner - Intelligent English/Aston. The problem is that we got here and the other foreigners seemed so beaten down and exhausted. They work 7 days a week. The foreign boss promises higher pay, a quiet life, and work visas. But once we got here and were supposed to transfer our work permit cards/residence permits to the schools, we were told the school was running into issues. It took a few weeks, but the other foreigners admitted that they had the same problem. The owner tried to force us into getting a travel visa and letting our work visa and residence permits run out, but I fought him. In the end, I won, but he treated me horribly after that. The other foreigners had to give in in the past, but ended up trapped. They work 7 days a week and if they try to force the boss to give them days off, he says he will call the police on them. We definitely want to leave this school, and have tried to legally and professionally, but he says he'll just cancel our visas completely and never give us the work permit cancellation so we can't have another job in China. We love living in China and have done so legally for years. What can we do? We've tried local agencies, but we're being told that basically in China the boss can get away with it in the end. To fight it in labor arbitration would take a year. They all told us to play dirty and report them to the police for all their illegal activity. Has anyone had a problem like this? Thanks",

I would do all of the usual stuff, then show a YouTube video to explain it again in their L1. It usually benefitted the less advanced students.\n\nI'd like to get something like that for Chinese learners, but YouTube is blocked and Youku is all in Chinese. Anyone know of any channels where decent Chinese-speaking English teachers do their stuff?\n\n\nMany thanks.",

This year, I'm starting a Mandarin Chinese Language Club and I have a question for those who teach at Chinese schools.\n\nAt the middle school I worked at in Hunan, students started every class the same. I'd like to do the same for my club. Can anyone tell me if this is correct or if I'm forgetting anything?\n\nTeacher: shang ke (class is starting)\nStudents, standing: ni hao laoshi, laoshi ni hao (hello teacher, teacher hello)\n\nAt end of class - Teacher: Xia ke! (class is over)\n\nAre there any other \"normal\" Chinese classroom procedures or cultural nuances that would be nice to teach elementary students learning about China? And, any videos you recommend for beginning Chinese learners?\n\nHope this is okay to ask and thank you in advance for any help.",

Somewhere between Grade 4 and Grade 8, I guess.\n\nAs for cultural nuances, the students were responsible for cleaning the classroom, once a week at the end of Wednesday's classes. Thus, Thursday morning we got to see a clean classroom, and Wednesday afternoons we saw a pig sty masquerading as a classroom.\n\nAnd spitting.

I am not shilling when I say that, no knife to the back or anything. The government seems to take the issue seriously. Managing the environment in general, well, maybe not much to learn, managing pollution levels in major urban areas, there is something to learn.\n\nYes, pollution levels in urban centers of China are much higher than Western nations. It is population. If the Chinese gov stepped away from the issue the whole world would see no sun again. Instead, thankfully, they do actually make a huge impact in decreasing the levels of pollution.\n\nOK, it does seem like I am shilling for China, but what I want to get to is there is an issue and it is being proactively addressed. I am a witness to that and so are many of the other posters who used to be around.",

At the SAME SCHOOL I also know a teacher over 60 is still working and getting residence permits, BUT he has been at the school for many years (like 15). So maybe length of service has some sway. Maybe the school just likes them and is pushing to help them. I dunno. It's weird.\n\nI think its nearly impossible to start a new job in Guangzhou if you are 60. It also seems unlikely you can come in at 58 or 59 and expect to stick around. But who knows. I would say talk to the schools about it, but I doubt any school is gonna tell you anything but the official govt line when they don't know you.\n\nGood luck!",

Rent can be expensive, depending on where you want to live, but if you live a little bit outside of the main central hub you'll find a decent place for that allowance or a little bit more. Utilities, transportation and food costs are all pretty cheap in China across the board.

There are more than enough Chinese students with means who will want to study abroad.\n\nThe first reason given that Chinese students might stop coming abroad: More opportunities to study in China because the govt is spending billions upgrading the top 100 Chinese unis. I got news for you, that doesn't mean there are tens of thousands of more seats available in these classrooms. It just means they are making them nicer and better. Most of the students who can't get in there now will not be able to get in there in 10 years. And most importantly, this writer doesn't seem to understand that it is precisely the rich kids who can't get into the top universities who are going abroad to study so mom and dad can save face and brag to their friends about their kid abroad (rather than in an embarrassing lower tier uni). Every teacher in China who has worked in an IELTS program knows this is the case.\n\nThe Confucius Institute issues have no impact on a massive majority of the students studying abroad. Almost all of the other \"issues\" here are guesses at what could happen because of cultural issues down the road. There's no imminent crisis. As long as there are $$$ available, this system will continue on for quite some time.",

The reason is there are plenty of 'anglerfish schools' waiting to attract your attention and essentially do something to you that is not good. Unfortunately there are plenty of them in China, along with all the schools in Thailand and other countries.",

Throughout the whole process I've been in touch with a few agencies. Recently, I've been told by one of the recruiters that as a non-native speaker I am only eligible for a Z-visa in Zhejiang province, nowhere else. I've accepted a job in Fuzhou (Fujian province), I've asked the principal of the school if she's confident they would be able to get me a work visa. She said that 'the person who's putting the proposal together thinks so'. That still doesn't instil 100% confidence in me.... So my question is - does anyone know for sure what the current situation in Fujian province is? I should also mention that I am from the Czech Republic, my MA, Celta and QTS are from the UK and the majority of my teaching has been done in the UK too (around 10 years). The school I've been hired by is an 'international' all-Chinese school where I'd be teaching ESL.\n\nMany thanks,",

There are non-native speakers in EVERY province with Z-visas. But it seems to depend more on the local authorities than provinces, the relationships employers have with those authorities, whether a certain govt employee thinks your quals are good enough...needless to say a variety of factors. I would say there is NO GUARANTEES for non-native speakers these days, and anyone who tells you there is...well, you need to see the visa in your passport.",

        "content": "Chinese to redefine native speaker teachers?\nEL Gazette | Jan-Feb 2019\nhttp://www.elgazette.com\n\nChina is set to redefine native-speaker teachers to include citizens of former colonies where English is used as a second language, according to Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago Santa Romana.\n\nTalking to the press after discussions with President Xi late last year, Santa Romana told the Manila Standard: ‘They expanded their definition of English-speaking countries. They said native-speaking countries and countries that were colonised by these native-speaking countries.'\n\nSuch news, if confirmed, will come as a relief to recruiters who have struggled to fill posts in the country’s private language schools, estimated to number at least 50,000, with native-speaker teachers who meet the visa requirements of a first degree, a TEFL certificate accepted by the government, and two years classroom experience.\n\nTo fill the demand, agents have taken to hiring native speakers with no qualifications and sending them into the country on student visas with the promise they can switch to a teaching visa on arrival. This resulted in waves of crackdowns, where unqualified teachers are rounded up, detained and then deported (e.g., over 50 South African teens were rounded up and flown out of China just before Christmas).\n\nHowever, teachers from ESL countries may face severe restrictions, if the agreement on Filipino teachers signed early in January is anything to go by. Under the agreement, teachers, who must have a first degree or post-graduate degree in English teaching, are forbidden from working for the state sector and can only teach in ‘tertiary education.’ This is thought to mean they can only work in private language schools for adults and cannot be hired in China’s burgeoning young learner market.\n\n(End of article)",

Pre 2013, China experienced a moderate shortage of native speaking teachers and the supply was augmented by speakers from other countries usually working illegally. The biggest reason then why China had a shortage was due to poor working conditions, poor pay, mistreatment etc. Three out of four teachers left within a year. China decided to address the issue by making it impossible for non native speakers to teach via a very onerous work permit process and stepping up the enforcement through raids. They made a very slight attempt to address the issues of mistreatment. Then they added the social tax which directly and more so indirectly has dampened wage increases despite soaring demand. Now they have created the current situation which they are addressing by permitting non native speakers to teach legally. One can argue to what extent non native speakers are qualified to teach English as a second language, but it will undoubtedly suppress wages for native speakers further and exacerbate the shortage they tried to eliminate. A pretty funny and very Mainland Chinese strategy.",

ON THE OTHER HAND, despite all the whining (and outright dishonest claims) on this thread, teacher salaries are at an all time high in China right now and continue going up because of the demand, while other ESL locales like South Korea and Japan have had utterly stagnant salaries for a decade.

The General Discussion forms seem rather dead on here and I think the biggest market for this would likely be in China anyway.\n\nAny input would be much appreciated. Thanks all!",

You'll get a card, it's an ATM card, which will allow you to check the balance, but not withdraw cash directly. You can also use it at pharmacies to pay for medications, and at hospitals to pay for treatment. There are certain restrictions on both, but I'm not familiar with all of them. You can claim it back either when your contract ends or you leave China. It's easy if you are a fluent Chinese speaker of have help. You go to the nearest government social security office and fill in a form and sign it and the money will be available to withdraw from an ATM in about 6 working days. They'll give you a printout of the accrued amount.",

I can talk a little but I've only been doing it about two months, so I'm not an expert.\n\nAs Simon In Suzhou mentioned, you have to be careful of the badly run online teaching companies, so you need to do your research. I suggest joining an Online Teachers Group on Facebook, it's got thousands of teachers on it and some really good reviews of the popular schools\n\n\nThe requirements for good money are 1. Native Speaker 2.University Degree 3. Willingness to work Beijing peak times. If you're a University teacher in China yourself I'm sure you fulfill all of those.\n\nI've also noticed two types of teaching companies. 1-The company assigns you classes. This is probably the best way to make a lot of money, as you'll always have students but you're stuck to that schedule, and can lose money if you have to cancel class to do anything.\n\n2.-You try to find students yourself on the platform. That's the one I'm doing. It took about 3 weeks to get a steady supply of students, but now I have so many I've had to post a note saying I'm not accepting any more. You probably make less money this way BUT there's also no penalty if you decide to cancel class, so there's a lot more freedom.\n\nEnding it here because I'm worried about the word limit, but let me know if you have more questions and I can answer below!",

I'm not sure if that's common for other online teaching apps. I'm doing some more research on online teaching companies, and this was just the first and easiest one I found, so I might move on in the future.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

I am trying to complete the necessary paperwork but I am stuck at a roadblock.\n\nI left China in July 2018 when the residence visa and contract expired on my last job. I was a good employee and had a professional relationship with my job when I left. I left to travel and take a break back home. Flash forward 5 months later and they have proved to be extremely unhelpful in giving me a necessary document to allow me to redo my visa from the USA.\n\nIt took them a month to issue my new job the release letter. However when my new school turned this document into the visa office in the city I am trying to relocate to, the new visa office now also said that my old job had not completed my paperwork to cancel my old work permit correctly. So the new visa office wants my old school to provide a new letter fixing the errors they had completed while filing my originally cancellation of work permit letter. (I don’t know how this was even successfully submitted to the work permit office in the first place if the information on the letter had errors in it…)\n\nIt’s been over a month now of contacting my old job through email, having my new school contact them and even having old coworkers ask them to complete the paper work in person. They said they would do it to these people, and have not delivered anything nor responded to my own emails. I have sent friendly reminders, explained my situation and still nothing. It’s been a month waiting for some small document: literally one piece of paper. This is troubling to me because I left the job on good terms and they even offered me a second contract.\n\nWhat can I do? What are my options? It’s literally the last document that the visa office needs to process my new working visa.\n\nKeep contacting my old job?\n\nCan SAFEA help me?\n\nAny advice would be very helpful. Thanks.",

I have a friend who had connections to an inside source that told me that bureaucratic runarounds are just a way to discourage those who are qualified from coming. Not all of them are unlucky, but they don't want too many of us there. Just go onto Google or YouTube and search \"why foreigners are leaving china\". They do target those who may know too much and they like it better when we are a smaller minority and don't know a whole lot.

Most schools do not reimburse you for travel coming to China prior to working with them (although a few do). Most will give you travel money at the end of each term or even at the end of your contract. Most don't care where you're going/coming from.\n\nI would say most universities give you a flat payment in cash. There are a few that go through the reimbursement process, but most don't.

May or June should be fine for September.

If so, is this possible without having to leave the country? Or is a HK run or something like that expected?\n\nI have been interviewing with a lot of places in China and nearly all the schools in Shanghai which are interested in me are insisting that converting the L visa to a Z visa is possible in Shanghai. I am interested in one school. They have a legit looking website, the people who I have added on WeChat from this school have lengthy posts on their moments about school functions showing school buildings and even the foreign teacher manager who interviewed me. They also have their regular life stuff in posts. What I am saying is that they look like real people. I have even found several foreigners from this school who are on LinkedIn. These people look real too. So I don’t think or feel this school is trying to scam me. However that being said, I thought that converting an L Tourist visa to a Z visa wasn’t possible.\n\nAny comments from people who have done this, or who are familiar with this process are greatly appreciated.",

Maybe she could just visit or volunteer , rather than getting paid work, and the school could provide accommodation , meals etc? (if she doesn't need the money). But even 'voluntary work' is I believe not allowed with an L visa).\n\nWhat I had in mind was some kind of guest lecturer or international adviser where the school does not actually employ her, but issues the invite.\n\nI don't whether all the paperwork is needed for an F visa as for the Z visa, but criminal clearance , degree authentification etc would possibly cost her more than she would make in three months here.\n\nSorry, this situation is rather complicated and dependent on unknowns like how long she will work in China , or whether she is using the three months as a tryout period .",

China for me was always a fine balance between the ease and relatively inexpensive process of being here versus the crap I've had to put up with in the 8 1/2 years I've been here.\n\nIn that 8 1/2 years salaries have risen at about a tenth the rate that prices have risen. Buses are still overcrowded. Pollution has stayed the same. Xenophobia has stayed the same but now I'm supposed to shell out around 5k RMB for the privilege of taking a job with a company that sees me as a piece of meat to be exploited to the maximum and discarded as soon as my value to them diminishes.\n\nEdited to address the OP. You probably run less risk if you work for cash or Wechat transfer and don't pay the taxes, thus not bringing yourself to the attention of the authorities. Probably best to set at least 10% of it aside though so if you do get caught you can pay the back taxes, and use your savings to pay for the fine and cost of deportation. That being said, in my 8 1/2 years I've yet to hear a credible account of anyone actually being caught.",

Many also take HUGE bribes from students for grades.

High salary jobs are often long hours with extra requirements for availability, even if the class hours are not high (Remember an 8 hour day is not an 8 hour day in China. It's 8 hours + the 2 hour naptime. That often means going in at 7am, not 9am). They often also have added stresses. High paying jobs not in international schools are often one foreign teacher in a completely Chinese workplace, with the expectation that you will fit into that workplace as such, sacrificing your independence, outspoken opinions, and sometimes being afforded the same \"respect\" as Chinese employees, which is often too much for Westerners to cope with in the long run.",

I've been offered an interview with Shuren Middle/High School (I think that's the name of the school, otherwise it's a group of schools under a business name 'Shuren').\n-It pays 18000rmb per month over 16 months (the contract runs from mid-February 2019 to mid 2020).\n-The contract states a maximum of 20 teaching periods per week with 156rmb per extra class if I get overtime.\n-8000rmb each way for the airfares.\n\nI could probably teach at an international school however I more or less have quit primary teaching in Australia (I have taught ESL in China before though, mostly in Guangdong). There are a couple of little things that concern me in the contract details regarding leave (I'm planning to spend a week in Japan to watch the Rugby World Cup in October, I may go in September before the CNY Spring festival period however my plan was to go there in mid-October with a couple of mates from Australia as I'm still in Sydney right now). However, I'm generally okay with the contract. But is it better teaching at a Chinese public school (I've worked for recruiters who assign teachers to public schools but not a private high school).\n\nI'll admit from past experience I only enjoyed living in Guangzhou and Shenzhen (I've tried to live in a small town near Chengdu and a small distant town in Suzhou). In both cases, I was put in a position where I had to do extra work (right after arriving in China) due to the schools not having enough teachers (I got worn out and angry, in both cases I did a runner). In the tier 1 cities I stayed in I finished the contracts and I also found it easier to do things outside of home (along with having more friends, particularly foreigners but also a few Chinese).\n\nI guess that's my worry with living in a place like Yangzhou; it's a difficult place to travel from I believe. I'd love to hear from anyone who has lived and worked there.",

Though I really enjoy teaching and find that it's my true \"calling\", I'm embarrassed to say that I've never been invited to work for a university for more than 2 years. Even with the universities where I've worked for two years, I wasn't offered a new contract so smoothly like other foreign teachers have.\n\nI had a meeting with the Deans of my university department today about the reasons they didn't choose to hire me back at this university. The main reason they said is that students sent a complain letter to the President of the ENTIRE school about me being constantly late and eating during classes. They said that a letter was not only sent last semester, but this semester as well.\n\nQuestions:\n\n(a) Do you ever eat during class? Even something simple like Bao Zi or dumplings? Does your school (or students) think it's a cardinal sin for the teacher to eat something during class? Do you think a student would really send a complaint letter to the dean or president about something so simple as this?\n\n(b) Are you ever late to your classes? Such that other teachers in the hallway notice and tell the deans? One of the deans told me that other teachers were calling me out for that (the classrooms have windows facing the hall). I am late sometimes, but usually by only 1 or 2 minutes (never something drastic like 10-15 minutes).\n\n(c) I scolded 2 students one day (in 2 different classes) for openly using their phones immediately after telling them not to use them (I have a traffic light signal in the class which tells them when they can and can't use their phones). I am known by students as a being a very sensitive person. But I later apologized to the students and told them that it doesn't affect my opinion of them. These students claimed to me that they didn't send the anonymous letter to the president, and would never cross me like that. They said that they think I'm a very friendly and kind teacher. ",

Well, I did not come here because I could not keep a job, it was more a lack of jobs (or interest in the small pool that were out there). I studied Chinese, so thought I would give this a try. I would say, being on time, not eating in class, and dressing well are things that are simple. It gets no where near the hoops one has to jump through back home. I am moving towards 11 years here and have gotten quals and such, so my job is slightly more demanding, but they are by no means going beyond reasonable expectations. Dress well, be on time, don't smoke in front of students, etc. Otherwise, I am free to run my class as I please.\n\nI will say, and I mean nothing negative or condescending towards you, maybe it is time you re-evaluate your motivation for being here. With your contract not being renewed (Happened to me in Spring of 2017), it is a chance to rethink such things. I have a wife and son, was told last minute. In my case apparently I was sick too much, even though at that place teachers had to make up any sick days (confusing).

They also required it NOT be online and from a Western university. One didn't necessarily want to spend their life in Saudi Arabia, but the ability to spend 10 months there say every 4 years and really pad the nest egg was enticing.\nHowever, despite a recent rise, the long-term prognosis for oil prices looks very bad, given American Shale oil. Thus the long term outlook for the Gulf states looks even worse, and already the heady days of super salaries seems to be over, with much greater decline in the future.\nAn MA TESOl also gives you the theoretical ability to teach in tertiary-level ESL programs back in the West, though salaries will be low and expenses high. And even such low-status jobs will be hard to come by. Nevertheless, it is a theoretical path back home for some longtime ESLers who have no other way to ever return home and work better jobs than at Walmart.\nNottingham University's Ningbo campus in China has an excellent MA TESOL program you can do for a reasonable cost, with few prerequisites in under a year. It doesn't appear too demanding, and with the current changes to student Visas in China, one could theoretically do a fair bit of legal teaching on the side to subsidize costs. Most importantly, unlike with a lot of Western university campuses in China (or so I have heard), the diploma is 'pure': There is no joint-program mentioned on it, or even China campus. It's the same diploma you would get if you took the classes in the UK.\nThe MA TESOL doesn't really give you access to any better jobs RIGHT NOW, but as China ages and there are less students, and the whole ESL industry shifts and matures, it might protect your ability to make a living overseas in the future. Also, under the current Z Visa points system, you start losing points as you age, but you get back points for the Ma",

        "content": "The teaching license is more complex, and I haven't looked into it in as much detail. With the MA TESOL, you're more likely to be gravitating towards university and college work.\nThe teaching license can get you access to true (and even still lucrative 'fake') International Schools all over the world. You're likely to be teaching younger kids, but middle and high school kids are possible and, similar to the college level, typically involve less stress about serious classroom management than with kiddies.\nIdeally, the best International schools want (or at least used to want) two years teaching experience in a Western country. But that is not absolute. Also, whereas back in the West you likely have to match up the level you focused on for your license (primary, middle, high school), overseas a lot of International schools who do demand a teaching license will likely let you teach high school kids even if your license was for elementary.\nElementary qualifications are the easiest because you don't have to have certain configurations of undergraduate courses that match the focus of your 'teachables' in the education program. For many, getting high school-level teaching qualifications could require you to take a bunch of undergraduate university classes before you actually do the year needed for the education degree. Furthermore, unless (and maybe even if) you aim at the least desirable teaching jobs back in the West, competition for all teaching jobs means you are unlikely to ever get a regular teaching position 'at home' given most people who get a teaching qualification late in life will be old, without much 'proper experience' and won't have their education degree from a first-rate education program.\nBut if I can figure a decent path to it, I'm starting to lean towards the teaching qualification over MA TESOL. The ability to find jobs with a decent western-style salary in countries all over the world, often ones with low costs of living, is really good insurance in c",

Having a teacher's certificate gives you an escape route back home in case things go badly wrong in China , or elsewhere, (I mean for foreigners in general , or with the visa situation, things which are out of your control).",

As a Canadian, there were no special or shortcut paths to a certification that I could use like Americans and British.\n\nIn Canada, teachers are treated fairly well and the education schools and programs are competitive. Back in 2010, I was told I'd have zero chance of getting into any real Canadian University education program, and my best chance was to go overseas, mainly UK or Australia, where they have one-year certification programs for Canadians that would get me a license.\n\nHowever, when they looked at my transcripts, it looked like I would have to do some undergraduate work to get more teachables if I wanted to be able to teach anything but elementary school.\n\nFurthermore, the best International Schools wanted two years experience teaching in a Western nation. Many International Schools would waive that, but until you got those two years, you would be permanently a second-class citizen in the International School game--experience teaching at International Schools overseas would never completely compensate for not having those two years at home.\n\nAnd getting two years of teaching experience in Canada would be very difficult, especially with a license from an overseas program (looked down upon by employers).\n\nI'll have to look at things again. There may be some teaching positions for less attractive candidates in some of the poorer areas of the UK. But all in all, to do things perfectly, it looked like a 3.5 year process. Half a year of online undergraduate work to get my courses lined up, a year in a teaching program, and two years teaching somewhere fairly awful in maybe Northern Canada or inner-city UK. The total expenditure looked to be over $60,000 (in 2010) for the undergraduate courses, the year of teaching education (tuition + living expenses), several relocations, and subsidizing the two years teaching in Canada, UK, or Austral",

You can also teach in CEGEP programs in Quebec (French-speaking Canada) and in some college/university ESL programs in North America. But US Visas are hard to come by, these jobs are hard to get in general, and not very lucrative.\n\nTeaching certification seems like a much better route if I can find a way to do it efficiently. There's an interesting CANTEACH program that can get you certified for Ontario (my home province, if I really have a home province anymore) with a 1-year program that could cost as little as CAD$30,000 all in. You do it in Wales, Scotland, or New Zealand. (I'd still need to investigate how much undergraduate coursework I might need to do beforehand.)\n\nAnd there are other options, maybe online ones, I haven't explored yet. Being licensed in a Canadian province doesn't really seem to matter that much as the teaching job market is so tight that a teaching license is not really a path back to Canada. I might even look at moving to the UK or other Western nations with a teacher shortage as a possible long-term plan if I ever really age out of overseas teaching.\n\nAt any rate, just having a conversation here and appreciate any and all advice and experience.\n\nEdit: Canada having a teacher surplus may be old news.

I might consider Wuxi, Huzou or Hangzhou depending on the distance and time to Shanghai airport. I need a quick and easy access to it since I have a daughter here in Japan and I'm planning on visiting her as much as I can. I would greatly appreciate your inputs regarding these cities.\n\nSecondly from what I gather most of the jobs are in kindergardens, private language schools and primary/secondary schools. I read about training centers but I assume they're the same as private schools right? Again I wouldbe very appreciative if you could share your experiences and offer some opinions on these schools.\n\n\nThank you in advance for your responses.",

It's a teacher's market. Generally in China the amount of effort/hours you're willing to put in will equal your salary. You can get by and save a little teaching oral English at a college/uni with minimal effort and loads of free time. If you're ambitious you might take a second job or do some privates. You can slave yourself out full time to a private academy or kindergarten teaching kids which will usually entail exhaustion but a better paycheck. You can take a job in a real primary or middle school and make pretty good money, not teach too many classes, but probably have lots of meaningless desk time in an 8-5 kinda gig. Depends what you're looking for.\n\nWhat I think people should look for in job offers: SPECIFIC location of school (not out in the middle of nowhere hours from the city advertised), teaching hours, hours actually required at work, salary after tax, housing options (with photos if they provide the apt), how many other western co-teachers.",

The metro ride from Hongqiao to Pudong is looong and crowded. Unless your daughter lives close to Osaka or Tokyo airport, that means more hours spent traveling.\n3. Flights to Japan are rarely cheap. Japan is probably the most popular destination for mainlanders at the moment and they can keep relatively high prices.\nThe saving potential is probably better than in Japan, but with flights and other additional inevitable costs during travel, I don't see you saving a lot.\n\nIt seems like an odd plan to be honest. If you can't/don't want to stay in Japan for whatever reason, perhaps Korea would be a better option? 1. It's closer. 2. Flights are cheaper. 3. Planes are usually on time from what I've been told.",

Also how long is the train to Shanghai?\n\n@Mixal\nQuite frankly although I am interested in the country itself and the culture the main reason for working in China is the money. Salaries in Japan have been driven down steadily for a few decades and will probably continue to decrease. Some of the offers I got in China are basically twice what I'm making here in Japan, along with free housing, monthly and annual bonuses, flight allocation, etc.\n\nAs for the cost of flights I've reaserched it and although it will definitely be more expensive I'll still be way ahead financially than here in Japan. Your comment about planes being late is worrying on the other hand, how late are we talking about? And how long is the ride from Hongquiao to Pudong?

If it's a longer holiday, the flights will be a lot more expensive.\n\nHongqiao to Pudong is around 90 mins.\n\nAlso, regarding the public holidays. Most training centers won't know or won't tell you the schedule on purpose more than few days in advance. I can only see it somehow working if you are hired at an international (or \"international\") school close to airport (there are few of those, there's nothing around and they are far away from downtown so I'd guess if you're decent they would hire you).

You will need an authenticated degree, authenticated criminal check, and most likely a med check. This is not so cheap. Beyond that you might need to go back home country to apply for the correct visa (HK is possible but it really depends on the school/company).\n\nI am not trying to dissuade you, just giving possible pitfalls.\n\nGood luck",

As far as teaching jobs went, the fair was full of the chain companies like EF who no one generally wants to work for, and far-flung universities in places no one wants to go to offering 6000/month salary. Basically, the employers who can't attract teachers (For good reasons). It was a massive waste of a day, IMO.\n\nI have since learned that good teaching jobs in China generally don't have to advertise at all. China is the land of connections. If you want a great job, get to know people. Word of mouth. You might get lucky at an event like this or through a recruiter, but you're just as likely to end up in a miserable situation.",

If their goal was a top 10 Uni, they could still be in the top 20% of students nationwide, but don't want to attend a lower level public university. Many private universities are better than mid to lower level public ones. Many private universities are also not very good. So yeah.\n\nI taught at a very good public uni and a lower level public uni (where the students English was at elementary school level. Really.). I also taught at a decent private university where the students were not as good as the former but MUCH BETTER than the latter. The difference was my salary at the private uni was double what both public universities paid.",

My contract and work ends next month, and they have confirmed my final work day here. Yes, they refuse to pay my final paycheck until a month after I leave. I have emailed and talked to several people here, and they say they will not change their company policy. They also won't give me my travel bonus. They say I must purchase the round trip tickets first and prove I paid for them. Only then will they submit a request to the finance department to give me my bonus. It clearly states the amount in my contract. The final problem is my letter of release. No one I've talked to here will give it to me. They say they have hired out all their visa work and no one at the company knows what this is. They say their HR department has a policy of not giving out letters of recommendation until the last day of work. My problem is that I have no home within a few days of my contract ending. Companies I talk to about transferring to so I have a home need that letter to prove I can transfer my visa. Given the other promises that have been made by this company and not fulfilled, I cannot just trust they will give me the letter. Since foreigners must close our bank accounts before leaving the country (if we leave), isn't there any law stating a company has to pay the foreigners upon completion of their contract? Not making them wait a month? The person Roger who handles foreigners told me to my face yesterday that if I am not in the country where I can transfer my money to wherever I go, then that is my problem. Does anyone know of an agency I can hire to try to deal with my company? Is there a contact at the Labor board that anyone here has used? Thank you",

There are also some signs that the economy is going to feel some pain in the future, though when and for how long, it is hard to say.\n\nThat said, if you have the docs and quals for a proper Z Visa, it still seems to be the most lucrative place to teach in Asia at the moment for most ESLers, particularly if you are flexible as to what city you are willing to teach in.\n\nIn the past, the best way to make money was typically to get a Z Visa contract that was as efficient as possible in terms of total required hours (teaching, prep., office hours, paperwork, etc.) vs. salary, and then supplement with a lot of highly-paid side work.\n\nHowever, one gets the feeling that side work may become increasingly dangerous in the future. (As with predicting the fate of the Chinese economy, predicting the future danger level of side-work for Z Visa holders is difficulty.) Still, I'm increasingly of the opinion that it's better for savings to stat looking for the higher paying but higher work hours Z Visa jobs, even if they are less efficient. In addition, pay attention to 'summer pay'. A lot of great jobs did not pay you for the summer, but that was no big deal. Summer is also peak season for private institutions, so you could just go work there for two months. This is also 'seeming' a lot less safe.\n\nAll in all, if coming to China for the first time, and having decent experience and the needed requirements for a Z visa, I'd be looking for the high-monthly salary jobs that pay all year long, even if you have to put in 40 hours a week (much of it office hours).\n\nIn addition, if you can in any way become remotely qualified to teach AP courses in the sciences or maths or economics, you can get some great jobs. There are no strict requirements to be able to teach such courses: 3-4 years as a stockbroker could let you teach AP Econ; 4-5 math courses in college would be enough to let you teach AP calculus, e",

Also, with more stringent requirements being implemented, it can only help NETs have better conditions.

The stress and workload attached to working at a IS is not the reason that I moved into this game!

This should protect you from any changes in the enforcement level re: part-time work. Many such positions still exist.\nThe main imminent danger is the RMB tanking due to the economy slowing, trade wars, demographic aging, etc.\nBut what can you do? It is still typically better than anywhere else.\n\n@getbehindthemule: Being married to a Chinese definitely changes the equation. While a marriage Visa doesn't give you the right to work, and even the rare permanent residence doesn't give you the right to teach, you always have a Visa for being in China, no matter your age. Also, from what I have seen, if you are married to a Chinese and get caught doing work you aren't permitted to do, the Chinese typically will not deport and blacklist you (just a fine and maybe a short detention).

And every city is different. There is also no uniformity among CONSULATES in the SAME country. So I wouldn't see it as a bad sign that the employer is confused.\n\nThis year I learned the best way to get a job/change jobs in China is to get every possible document you MIGHT need, and then try not to be to angry when you find that you wasted an immense amount of time and money on unnecessary ones, as opposed to not having that one document that will prevent you from getting the visa.

However, this being China, there are degrees of illegality, and that part-time while properly documented would be punished less severely than say doing any teaching work on a Tourist or Business Visa, with no FEX.\n\nFor example, I read one post where someone with all the Z-visa/FEX docs got caught in Beijing tutoring on the side and wasn't automatically jailed and deported, but still fined 10,000 RMB.\n\nI've had other friends tell me that while you might wiggle out of it before it goes on the record, once officially recorded, part-time work on the side on a Z Visa will receive an automatic deportation, at least temporary blacklisting, and a fine.

I'm not sure of the logistics of this and if there are opportunities for labor exploitation while on a F visa. They also want me to work on a temporary basis that will last the rest of 2018 before making me a permanent employee. I guess this temporary basis lasts as long as it takes to get a Z visa. This again is something I have never experienced. Is this a new trend in China or is this an exception?\n\nIt's a shame if this is a disqualifier as the job pays extremely well. If somebody needs more info to answer this properly, they can message me and I'll get back to them ASAP. Thanks \n\nI should note that I am an Irish-American living in the UK. Is the F visa necessary because I can only obtain a Z visa in a country where I have citizenship? Never applied for a Chinese visa outside of a country where I had citizenship.

Which means you've got dual citizenship, or are you just American? If dual, it's a short hop to Dublin from the UK to get the visa processed. (Yes, I'm Irish)\n\nI did it recently and it took me approx 3 weeks total. The longest part being the delays from the Chinese administration, and the delivery of documents to China. The Embassy in Dublin was very quick to process everything, and if you have your documents organised/Signed off by the DFT quickly, it could be shorter than what it took me.\n\nIf you're american, then that's completely different.\n\nStill, Push for the Z Visa. Better to be secure. If they have the authorization/permits to have foreign staff, the Z visa doesn't take long to process (for Irish citizens anyway... I've heard horror stories for other nationalities)",

There's also a required 10 hours of teacher observations, which requires forms to be filled out that are all in Chinese, and I'm required to get permission from the teacher ahead of time before listening in.

Are you sure this isn't another class?), and weekly feedback assessing my own teaching each week.\n\nFor this amount of work, I'd have gladly worked for a dreaded training school for four times the salary. I'm considering whether or not to bring up my concerns but can't think of a tactful way to do it (\"Excuse me, sir, but I'm having some trouble finding where these teacher observations are stated as a job requirement in my contract...

Normally these institutions and programmes are used as Zhongwai Hezuo Banxue in Chinese, meaning they represent co-operation between Chinese universities and foreign partners.\n\nThe government has attempted to reduce and terminate non-degree programmes carried out by Zhongwai Hezuo Banxue institutions since the early 2000s. Recently some undergraduate programmes, especially in business and management, have also been abolished. The numbers were quite limited, however. This time the situation appears to be more complicated and offers more profound implications for the future development of such institutions and programmes.\n\nhttp://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180822101208887",

        "content": "I decided to go for an agent to do my Z visa in HK. I went with one recommended by a fellow teacher. This particular agency has a long history and has a good reputation from what I can pull up on the internet, including this site. The consensus seems to be that they're expensive but they get the job done.\n\nAnyway, I sent a message to the agent the next day at 4 PM when the visa decision was expected. She told me that the visa has been processed, with a big stipulation. It was initially rejected and the agency had to \"convince\" (whatever that means) the powers that be to change their decision. As a result, they expected me to add an additional $1000 HKD to the already steep charge.\n\nI went directly to the office with a million questions. They wouldn't tell me how they convinced the office and claimed it was corruption. I questioned why whatever they did needed another 1000 HKD. I pointed out that the agreement I signed said nothing about further costs. I argued that whatever they did must surely be covered by the already steep service charge. I added that as visa agents, their job is to try their best to get me a visa if I pay them money. I paid, they got it, end of story.\n\nShe went to the backroom to discuss the situation, and then returned to ask me for whatever money I had on hand. I told her I'm not giving her anything more. She asked how I'll get my passport back. I suggested I could bring a police officer so she could explain what's going on to him. Things escalated to me calling her a liar and expressing my shock that such a scam could still happen in a developed, civilized region like Hong Kong\n\nFinally, she relented and gave me the passport and my receipt at no extra cost.\n\nThis didn't sit well with me as I can't imagine a rejection could be changed to approval by \"convincing.\" Maybe I'm wrong, but it set.off a red flag. It's scary because this is a very well-known and popular agency\n\nWhat do you think?",

Seeing as they require payment upfront and almost 40% of what I paid was nonrefundable in case of rejection, and seeing as visa rejection is all word-of-mouth, what's stopping them from going further with their scamming - Collecting your money, sitting on it, doing nothing, and then just telling you it was rejected in order to keep your paid service fees?

The university salaries over there sound very high on paper.\n\nAnother thing to take into consideration is that less and less universities offer fully paid holidays (instead you are offered summer or winter \"bonus\" which is just a fraction of your monthly salary) and in some cases flight reimbursements went from 10k to 8k or even 6k, so the salary increase is relative.

You may need to go to their website to find it, as it's very scarce on sites like Amazon, for some reason. Make sure you don't get the alternate version of the text called \"Groundwork for College Reading\" without the words \"with Phonics\" in the title, because it will be missing the four chapters that you need. It gets very detailed and technical at times, so I wouldn't use it with students at a less-than-intermediate level.\n\nThe defunct publisher Houghton Mifflin put out a nice 46-page guide to phonics aimed at adults years ago, complete with exercises, but I have no way to send it to you through this forum, nor the series of handouts that I created to adapt it for ESL students.

No problems with Visa for me and housing eventually was provided and was fine.\n\nIf you are serious about teaching and can get along with people you will fit in well with Dipont. They do have fairly rigid expectations about professionalism but if you want to improve your teaching then go for it. If not you'll probably be pulling your hair out or get laid off after a few weeks/months. I'd really recommend them for the up and coming enthusiastic teacher who wants to learn new, tricks and learn how to organize themselves as teachers.\n\nAlso they give pay rises every year. The scale of pay is, I imagine, as good as any International school.",

If you're a certified subject teacher with experience, you should also be looking at other international schools. I left for a better paying job.\n\nThat being said, if you're just getting your feet wet in China, there are certainly worse places to get a start.

I'm not against the work, actually what you said about the health insurance sounds more worrisome, but maybe that's how it is with most insurance plans. I'd imagine if your job is in a bigger city (Nanjing, Shanghai), then a choice of clinics is not the biggest deal, but if you're in a provinicial city, I'm thinking that if I found a good clinic/doctor that I really liked, I wouldn't want to go elsewhere for insurance reasons. They claimed it was \"international insurance for expats\" or whatever, just hard to figure out exactly what that means or if it's going to get the service you hope for. I'm young and reasonably healthy, but I do have a couple issues for which I need ongoing care.\n\nGood to know that they generally have their act together though.",

You won't have to be there quite as long as Chinese teachers are, but it's not a huge difference either. Generally, it's better to get a school that isn't directly administered by the DiPont headquarters. They don't necessarily require this.\n\nDon't misunderstand me about the insurance; it pays for good places, but it won't pay for some of the very expensive clinics like United Family in BJ/SH. I didn't feel that it was lacking…but it isn't quite the same sort of insurance you'd get at, say Harrow, SAS, or WAB. I know of teachers who had serious health problems and were very well taken care of.\n\nAs others have mentioned, it is \"real\" teaching, and for the most part your colleagues will be real teachers. A position with them certainly is a step up from the typical English teacher gig, but it's also not the be-all-end-all.\n\nIf you'd like more info or have specific questions, PM me.",

Bottom line is I may have to go out of the country to get a Z visa so I can get a Residence Permit here locally. Its a long and sad tale fraught with drama and disappointment and everything you need for a good Franz Kafka novel. The Bureaucracy always wins. Their unbending rules and regulations are always and everywhere heavier than your resolve to fight.\n\nI'll state my basic question first, then launch into the backstory for those who are interested. Its illustrative of the new policies in China vis foreign teachers of a certain age.\n\nAnd the question is: can a foreigner (American) still get a Z visa in Hong Kong? Yes all the documents are in order, I have everything to qualify. I already have the Foreign Expert Card in hand from the Provincial FEB in my new Province.\n\nThe problem is that I'm currently in China on an S2 visa. The local police here want me to have either a Z or a currently valid RP. My RP expired June 30 this year and I have an S2 because the FAO in my old city was kind enough to get it for me to buy some time.\n\nWhy did I need to do this? Because the FEB in my old province denied my FEC application one week before my RP expired. Why did they do this? New China Policy: nobody over age 59. This gave me no time to think, not to mention do any planning on what to do next.\n\nSo I got the S2 which gave me 45 days to find something in another Province, which I did. The new FAO got my FEC and I thought everything was guns and girls until today. We went to the local police and they denied my RP application because I had an S2 visa. No negotiation.\n\nI can go back to the US, go to HK or go to Korea. Trying to find my best option here. Sigh\n\nSorry for the venting, hope you understand. Muchas gracias to any informed replies.",

You can walk there from the station . 4 day processing was 1490 HKD, but every country's passport has a different price structure and 'surcharge' (imposed by the China Foreign Ministry , not the agency).\nThey offered 2 day processing for 2490 HKD. (eg apply Monday am before 9.30, collect Tuesday pm after 1pm)\n\nI am not a new teacher in China , and like you , am pushing 60, so there is a good chance you also can get a z visa.\n\nMy school gave me lots of documentation , contract etc, but I only needed the 'Notification letter of Foreigner's work permit in the PRC' . A two page form with your and the school's details, in English and Chinese. You must have both pages. (even though the English one is just a translation of the Chinese one)\nIt's an online system so the form has a barcode ,and when the school applies to the local education office , it must specify that you will get the z visa in HK.\nBut , there is nothing on the Notification letter which mentions HK.\n\nUnder the old system you needed also a 'letter of invitation' , but this is no longer required.\n\nYou should print out the Notification letter in colour so you have the red government stamp.\nYou also need two photos , but the agency can take for you. They also guide you through filling in the application form.\nYou will need obviously address and contact details of your new school.\n\nThe agency is busy Monday morning , but seemed quiet on Tuesday (I had to go back because the school only gave me the chinese version of the Notification letter)\nI would recommend using an agent , because of the wait and uncertainty at the visa application centre on HK island, and Forever Bright definitely knew what they were doing.",

In my five years of experience working in China, I've met nationals of Nigeria, Russia, Philippines, Thailand, and India working as English teachers with valid residence permits, in both private and public schools, even in public university positions... All of them were in backwoods areas.\n\nXinjiang used to be one location where this was possible, but it recently closed the doors to all foreign residents. You might consider poorer provinces like Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, or Guizhou... The smaller the city within such provinces, the better odds you have. Realistically, you won't find work in big cities like Shanghai, Shenzhen, or Beijing... If you're comfortable in remote locations where the foreign community is minimal, most people can't speak a lick of English, and you'll be uncomfortably stared at by passers-by everytime you step outside, then try it out.\n\n've lived in such remote areas and there are some good parts. Amongst all the curious gawkers and photo-taking opportunists, you'll find quite a few very welcoming friends who will go out of their way to help you and show you hospitality. You'll also quickly be familiar with your surroundings... The nearest supermarket, the best barber, the best restaurants, etc.",

Then the masterminds of China decided to redo the visas and forbid teachers except for those from but a handful of native speaking countries. They also increased the enforcement of ensuring that teachers possessed the proper papers.\n\nFast forward to the last year. The masterminds made it so onerous for the desired native speaking teacher to obtain and maintain the proper papers (along with the direct and indirect dampening effect that the new social tax has had on salaries) that China has experienced a net loss of native speaking teachers. In the ultimate act of irony, it appears that the directive now coming out of Beijing is that native teachers are only \"preferred\", but \"qualified\" non-native speakers can obtain the proper papers. This will take a while to work its way into all the jurisdictions, and for many recruiters to realize the change. Yet I feel you have a good chance depending on your qualifications and to an arguable degree the color of your skin.\n\nI see a time in China's not-so-distant future where their actions will lead to a vast majority of teachers being non-native speakers. Any attempt by Mainland Chinese to improve quality almost invariably ends up the opposite.",

It will involve 25 hours per week of teaching. My concern is that with Shangqiu is its location; it seems to be nowhere close to any tier 1 city (but trains in all directions pass through there).\n\nI also have an offer from the Beijing Vocational College of Labour and Social Security with the same teaching hours and salary (plus a monthly food card valued at around 500RMB to use on campus). I had two Skype interviews for this position (which I've never had for a uni before). It's in Changping District which I think is around 2 hours by public transport to the city centre. With this position, I have to teach 3 different groups (high school, uni students, Chinese English teachers and have an English Corner once or twice a month).\n\nBoth positions have paid winter and summer holidays but they don't seem to have any set teaching program (I think I have to start it from scratch and recommend a text).\nMy former employer (Australian Higher Education Network, I previously worked for them at a college in Guangzhou) offered me 9000RMB per month for a position in Hangzhou (for around 18-20 teaching hours per week , no paid summer holiday). Until I got the above offers I was going to go to Hangzhou.\n\nIf anyone has any info on the positions/locations of Shangqiu or Changping/Beijing I'd love to know more before signing anything.",

Highly Recommended\n2. Recommended\n3. Soft Pass\n4. Hard Pass\n\nThis school is a 3. Soft Pass.\n\nPROS:\n\n22k package (18.5k or 19k after tax) as an ESL teacher without certification.\n8 hour days / Lunch counted (as of now)\n\nCONS:\n\nMosquitos (School feels like a swamp). Students walk around with electric mosquito rackets. This is no joke.\nSmall town feel. There's a Wanda Plaza mall and a Wal-mart.\nInflexible Leadership that tells you what you want to hear and don't follow through.\nPromise you everything, provide a contract with nothing.\nNo materials. No curriculum.\n22 classes (up to 24 and they will use them) / Extra duties (you will do extra work)\nSlow HR. Very slow.\n\nThese are general comments. There's more. A few specific things that have happened to teachers.\n\nTwo teachers fled without notice.\nThree were fired. All had teaching certifications. Fired for challenging status quo.\nTwo teachers (at least) contracted a specific subject. Upon arrival, given other age level outside of subject area.\nHigh school teachers required to monitor students for night study (2 hours 10 minutes once a week)\nHigh school subject teachers required to teach middle school. You will teach a few HS classes with a majority of middle school.\nKindergarten will have zero breaks.\nNo offices for teachers. HS teachers were kicked out of their office.\nHorrible bathrooms (normal in China).\nTeaching subjects to students that don't speak English.\nStudents thrown out of the local program are sent to the international program.\n\nBottom line: If you are a certified teacher, you can do better. If you are an ESL teacher without certification and you want to try and break the 20k barrier -- worth a shot to see if it is bearable. You will work harder here than other places. Much harder.",

There are trash trucks that drive by until late in the night and the entire smells like trash because the school located near the second largest garbage dump in China.\n\nThe apartment was just terrible they didn't even clean it and there was black stuff near all the windows. I did have a western toilet but seat wasn't even attached the toilet bowl didn't have a top. This is absolutely the worst apartment I've ever had in my life. I'll also add the apartment is right next to the road so yes trash trucks drive until really late night.\n\nThere are only two buses you can take to leave the school but they only depart in 30 minute frequencies and it's incredibly over crowded just outrageous you can never really go out and last bus leaves Tianhe Coach Terminal at 9:00 PM. The classrooms suck the computers work sometimes other times it can take 10 minutes to get it to work. It even got to a point that one time I went the night before and had someone replace the monitor. The next morning I arrive in class and realize someone came back and put in the old monitor and my students final exams were delayed for 15 minutes waiting for someone to fix the computer again.\n\nA lot of the students are lazy, they don't try, and they don't want a challenge. They'll complain if you make things too difficult for them or even push them a little then the administration will will basically tell you to just let them play games or let them do what they want. There were several times when students didn't do their work and I gave them no credit they complained and the administrators pressured me to give them more time to do it. It's basically just ",

I have never really understood the situation with these colleges, I’ve never been told anything about it, and up to now, didn’t really care. However, I would like to know now, as I have to write about it! All I know is that the students are quite a bit weaker.\n\nDoes anyone know anything about these kinds of colleges? Are they for students who don’t get high enough gaokao points to get into the main campus? Will students graduating from them be less competitive in the job market? Do families of these students have to pay more?",

My Uni had several campuses spread through the city, some for different kinds of students, and all the FTs taught at more than one campus. Teaching hours were reduced because of the extra travelling, if you taught there more than one day a week.\n\nMy understanding was that they were three year students, those who didn't make the gaokao score, but whose parents had more money.\n\nBut also one group of students started on the separate campus but if they did well enough in the first year exams they could join the four year track , and move to the main campus.",

I assumed it was a four year degree actually, the same as on the main campus, but it sounds like it may not be. I am quite sure that none of them plan to join the main university for a final year or anything though.\n\nAnyway, I should really have found out more about it by now myself, I’ve been going there for a year! It just coming up as part of an MA essay topic I’m writing, and I can’t ask them personally because I’ve finished classes for the summer. It is interesting that they pay more to attend these colleges, I suspected that. I do notice they are quite low in motivation and not very interested in their major. Many seem to think they are not good students because they are not attending the main university.\n\nIf anyone know anything else about the employment prospects of these students, or anything else, I would appreciate it.",

This is a very unlikely scenario based on what I know.\n\nIf you have a child in China who for whatever reason didn't do well enough on the university exam to secure a place and you can afford it you send them to a college to grow up a little. To a large extent they are warehouses for the immature and disaffected. I recently read a BBC article and it said that 25% of all Chinese students don't do well enough to secure a place at a university. That is a staggering amount.\n\nChina surely must be among the most competitive places on earth when it comes to securing a good job. Even good university graduates struggle. Where do you think that leaves these college graduates?",

You could get adults (18-23), or those still in Middle/high school (14/15+).

They are for students who didn't take the gaokao (they take a separate exam) or who failed to get the required gaokao score. Often these are vocational colleges and offer things like computing, english for hotels and tourism, etc.\n\nColleges affiliated to a Uni are often privately funded , charge higher tuition fees, and can be three or four year. Students here have usually failed the reach the required gaokao score, but want to graduate from Uni. If the Uni asks you to teach in an affiliated one, there is no visa issue.\n\nMy second Uni assignment in a southern province was in a private college inside the large campus of a good Uni. The college had about 20 foreign teachers , who taught every subject to English majors. My employer was the college, in the Uni, if that makes sense. And the students (who paid higher fees than regular uni students) graduated after four years from the Uni, although there was some fuss while I was there about the wording on the certificate, to make it clear that they had studied at this college , and not just at the Uni.\n\nBecause the students came from well-off families, who often had their own business, the graduates seemed to do well after graduating and had no trouble finding jobs. The students there seemed more worldly and sociable than you sometimes find in public Unis where the kids have studied relentlessly to get a good gaokao score , but know nothing of the outside world or how to interact with people.",

Students are supposed to be earning a US high school diploma, but they are not capable of high school level work in English. Teachers are pressured to give students grades of 80% or above and cheating in rampant. There is very little support for teachers in all areas related to academics - no training or professional development, subpar materials, terrible technology. In addition there is no effective disciplinary support whatsoever. For example, students brought a tazer to school. When a foreign teacher caught them playing with it and confiscated it, the school had a series of meetings that resulted in telling the students they were on \"probation\" and if they misbehaved again they would be expelled. They were smoking on campus just days later - no punishment again. Because the students know they will not be held responsible for their behaviors, even small problems become impossible to control. There also seems to be racism against foreign teachers of color - teachers cut to half time in favor of white teachers, teachers given poor assistance and living conditions in comparison to others, etc. Avoid this school - there is better out there.",

They care so much about the grade you give them that I have had several start crying.

That means students who are having difficulty are given a better grade, when they really need outside tutoring to improve.

I tried to look up info about the school on esl teachers board . Heard some bad things. Found a few positive reviews. I asked for a SAIC license. When I told the agent this she said they could not produce it. Later I contacted the school interviewer on the WeChat about the SAIC license and they sent me images of official looking documents but of course, they’re in Chinese and if someone can verify their authenticity let me know.

Umm yes it does actually!\n\nI can’t believe you are marking 60 papers every week though. You are obviously a conscientious teacher and the students are very lucky that you do that for them but I think you need to cut back, even if you end up back with the 2 classes. I have 2 writing classes, last semester 3 and I definitely don’t collect their workfor marking every week, I do it about 3 times a semester. I rotate it aswell so that I don’t have 60 papers at the same time. Nomad Soul’s ideas for giving the students responsibility are good. Maybe try out peer feedback using a checklist or something to help them get used to it, go through error codes etc. I was sceptical about doing it at first but it actually worked ok.",

Those who will put themselves through such efforts for so little pay and so little appreciation.\n\nWhen I worked at a Uni, earning my 'generous' 7300 a month after taxes, I never taught writing even once, and I never would have. For that pathetic salary they get Oral English and that's all. It's absurd in the extreme to deal with writing given the workload necessary. And then, you apparently are adding to it...60 papers a week?! How? Why? Why would you not cut that back, focus on smaller things like sentence structure or passive voice or thesis development, or a million other things they doubtless need. They can do worksheets, and then trade with a partner, and then grade themselves in class. You can just guide them to the right answers.\n\nDoing that kind of intense weekly composition probably isn't even helping them, as they are just repeating the same mistakes over and over. They should break down their writing and work on the small parts one at a time. Then, at the end of term, they can do one major composition to be graded by you.\n\nAgain, this year I was teaching (1) writing class at my HS. And I did nothing remotely close to 60 papers a week grading (more like 60 papers a semester) and I was paid 2.5 times a 'basic' Uni salary for this. Some of you guys do not seem to understand the appropriate balance of work to pay for foreigners in this country.\n\nWhy would you put yourself through this? Find another job. Oral English only if you stay at a Uni. Make sure it's stated clearly in the contract. If they won't and offer only verbal assurances, don't sign.",

Many freshmen Uni students are reeling from the rigours of the high school graduation year and need time to get used to Uni life, and they expect a little slack and fun from the foreign teacher.\n\nI'm fairly sure , on the question of assessment , that the Uni will want to see it in a standard form, that matches the other teachers' assessment method - 70% final exam , 30% coursework or whatever. Unis are not totally hands-off their foreign teachers.\n\nGood luck .

The better lessons will teach the use of English within a business concept. For example, students learn what marketing is while using English. Lessons should build upon each other.

I live in Japan and will be visiting Ottawa for two weeks in early August, so my question is, \"Can I get everything done to obtain the Z Work Visa in 10 working days?\" From what others have written in regard to some of my other posts about this matter, the only thing I can do from here in Japan beforehand to help in expediting the process is use a document service like you are to send my highest degree to get notarized and then authenticated at the Chinese Embassy. Since I no longer live in Ottawa, I cannot get the Criminal Background Check through the Ottawa Police, who now require you to be a resident of the area. I went to the local Police HQ here in Japan, and they can take my prints, and I can send them by regular mail to a service which will transfer them to a digital format, and then send them to the RCMP for a Criminal Background Check. According to the RCMP's website it takes 3-4 working days, but like the Visa for China Office in Ottawa, they state on their website, that due to the volume of applications, there can be delays. For the health check, I will go to a Walk-In Clinic, like the one I used in the summer of 2015 to get one done for a visa for Saudi Arabia. My concern is then going to one of these private labs to get the blood tests, X-Rays etc., which is done by a first come, first serve basis. According to the Embassy of China's website, they do offer a 'rush service.' My future employer (a university), has said they will help me in anyway they can, which would in this case, allow me to show up later than the start of classes on September 1st in China, if my application is delayed. According to the inquiries I have made, if the paperwork is not completed before I fly back to Japan on August 15th, I could have it mailed to me here. Sorry for the long ramble.\n\nBigZen",

The first place was a mold infected dump and I complained so they put me in a temp place that I share on the weekends which is only good until the end of the month.\n\nThe school asked me if I would take 2000 allowance which I refused so they want me to pay the amount over 2000 not to exceed 1000 assuming they can find something decent for 2500-3000. I agreed to go along with it but told them they should honor the contract and that I was not pleased.\n\nI am waiting to see what they come up with. I don't want to get into a messy situation with the FAO, lawyers, etc. However, I would appreciate any thoughts or feedback. In my opinion, they should suck it up and pay for a decent place, it is the cost of doing business but logic does not always prevail here.",

However when I switched my first job to another province in the 3rd year I had to get a new police check from my home country as Heilongjiang province had it set as a requirement at the time regardless of anything I already had and this was explained to me by the FAO at the school I was moving to. Not all provinces are equal, some far more fussy than others.\n\nPersonally from your post I think if you haven't seen the red flags already then maybe take my advice and don't go there.

Lets see if we can compile a list of good/bad Agents people could contact.\n\nI've found that googling for jobs usually ends up with some kind of Agent at the end of the offer. There is so much junk info out there about scams.. it's hard to know what to think.

Teachers will later have the option, in many cases, to sign directly with the school for their second contract.\nMany teachers, myself included have used agents. The reliable ones dont take a cut of your wages but have already been paid a finders fee by the school.\nIn many cases when you sign with an agent, the school pays your salary directly. The agent might cover your insurance, housing & flight allowance. They can be very beneficial to newbies as many will help you find an apartment and broker the contract, help with phone contract, opening a bank account, etc. These can be daunting tasks on arrival without a word of Chinese.\nA personal side story:\nMy first month's salary wasnt paid (other teachers had received their salary that morning but I had not), so I contacted my agent. The agent in turn contacted the school and discovered that there had been a mix up. The agent then offered to put my salary on my credit card that day or I could come to the office and collect it in cash. That was the only issue I had and it was resolved very efficiently.\nNot all agents are bad, just do your homework first!",

She was very nice and helpful. Initially, I had wanted to stay in Chengdu. She kept me in the loop, but said she just could not find anything there. She asked me if I wanted to look at other options, she did not just throw things at me hoping something would stick. I said ok, a few days later she gave me three positions, all paying much better and with much better benefits than what I had before. One was Beijing, one in Jiangsu, and one in Fujian. I said ok, I am willing to interview with them. She said go ahead and interview with the Beijing one, but I would not recommend it. The pay/benefits are the same as the other two, but Beijing is more polluted and expensive (pollution came up because she knew I had a family). I interviewed with the Jiangsu employer directly. She asked after the interview if I still wanted to talk to the others. The interview went well, so I said we could wait until the Jiangsu job responded. She said fine. Jiangsu job came with a very solid offer so I accepted. She did not force or push me either way. Nice woman in my opinion.",

If you have a certain few cities you want to work in, and you should, it makes it even easier.\n\nMyself, I am trying to find the higher paying jobs at international departments of high schools. These are not so simple to find, and my experience has been that nemadecaomei is correct, these schools do tend to use agents to sort out the candidates that they want to talk to. I've rarely seen any public posting of these job offers, and as for, I don't know, trying to figure out their names and emails via Google and then blind-mailing them resumes in the hopes that they might have an opening and want to hire you...well, I just haven't had any luck with that strategy. There's no master listing somewhere that I've found that can even say what programs exist in any given city, so how you would find the information you would need in order to apply without an agent telling you about it is beyond me.\n\nThis isn't even to mention the places like Search Associates or Dipont that work with certified teachers to get the actually REALLY good jobs. If I get one paying 25K a month via an agent (last week I was a hair away from getting that, a job I only even knew to try for because of an agent), I'll happily be a 'needy' person.",

        "content": "Since nothing is ever forever in China, it may be possible to do this now. But what I always understood was that if you've never gotten a Z visa before, the first one has to be done in the home country.\n\nAs far as getting them from other Chinese embassies in Asia goes, I personally got one in Hong Kong last year, but that was my second. I don't think Chinese embassies are known for being terribly interested in working with non-citizen, non-permanent resident foreigners in most countries. There was a thread here months ago about a poster trying to deal with the Chinese embassy in Manila and they wouldn't do anything for him. My instinct would be that you wouldn't get far in Japan either.\n\nI doubt there's any formal restriction on it, but I think the idea is that the embassy in Japan serves Japanese people, and if you're Canadian, you should go to the embassy in Canada. I also doubt strongly that they would look favorably on a Japanese CBC done on a Canadian, or a Canadian degree authenticated by a Japanese lawyer. China wants things to match. Otherwise they have to do too much thinking.\n\nAs for time in Canada, it depends on if you have all documents ready to take in the office on the day of arrival. If you pay them for express service you should be okay. If you don't have your documents you're going to be in trouble. Especially the CBC.",

Due to a family emergency I had to book a last minute flight back home. I was working in an International Department teaching a subject. After things settled down i contacted the school to provide a brief notice and marks I already tabulated up to departure but haven't really talked to them since.\n\nI am not looking to go back, the city I was in was far too underdeveloped, the school was not licensed to teach an AP program -they were not registered with the AP College board, the students barely spoke grade level English couldn't understand the textbooks nor the teacher, the previous subject teacher prior to me was showing movies during class for the entire 2 semesters hence a lot of disciplinary issues, needless to say I felt I was wasting my time and skills being there with no value added.\n\nI have read some other posts about other teachers here who unfortunately experienced far worst student disciplinary issues (violent acts against them). My experience there was not on that level but yikes compared to my previous school in China it was like I was in the twilight zone for a good 3.5 months.\n\nSorry to digress, my main question is I am back in Canuck country, family issues dealt with and looking for Sept starts, will I run into issues getting a new work visa? Leaving early might have gotten me black listed since I need a release letter, closure of my FEC, recommendation letter etc. Last I heard from the school they closed my residence permit.",

You have the required qualifications and experience for a teaching visa, so accept that.\n\nAround 5500 is livable in the countryside or in a smaller city, but you'll want some money for travelling. All the Tier 2 cities have become more expensive, and while you can eat local food, you will find plenty of other expenses all around which will cut quickly into your salary. Tier 1 cities can be very expensive depending on your interests.\n\nDunno, if you're male/female, and interesting in dating, but if you're planning on dating some Chinese women, then expect to pay for most things with them... which can rack up the costs during a month.\n\nIn other words, aim for 6500-7000 as the baseline salary, and do try for more.

A late teacher is better than a headache with the authorities/previous school over a teacher who broke contract.\n\nNew term starts end of August at the earliest, as long as you apply for your new residence permit before the old one expires you are good.\n\nTL;DR - Schools that push you to break contract are a huge reg flag, super shady stuff in my opinion. Don't break contract if you want to continue working in China, any good school will wait for you.",

No metro when I was there but it was under construction so may be closer to completion. Buses, taxis and e-bikes were the order of the day for getting around town.",

I was lied to by a certain Yangyang, who told me I could choose where to teach, in the International School, or the English majors. If I chose the International School, I could teach a literature course \"Master Works of Literature.\" After travelling half of China from Heilongjiang province, I was told neither of these were possible. This was a prerequisite for me, since I hold two Masters degrees in Literature and don't wish to spend a year on Oral English.\n\nBut the bigger problem was the state of the apartment I was given to live in. Half of the equipment was broken or very old, holes in the walls, dirty, desk with broken drawers, last teacher's junk everywhere, dirty rag tucked in the folds of the coach, etc. I told them I would be travelling to Europe in August and September and this would give them ample time to repaint and replace some of the antiquated, broken equipment. I was promptly told to leave for complaining. They would \"find another one.\"\n\nThis place is a shame to China and I'm hard pressed to understand what kind of juvenile, docile worm would say this is an \"awesome\" place. Who knows, maybe the students are great, but the administration is beyond evil. Yangyang, a twenty-something-nothing with no academic accomplishments aparently runs things. The Dean of the International School didn't respond to my emails outlining how I was lied to, lured halfway across China at my expense, promptly and arbitrarily fired by someone with no academic credentials. I could go into greater detail. I have photos of the apartment for anyone interested in a position at this school. Contact me at thomas_starky@yahoo.com\n\nAugust 9, 2012 at 4:47 AM",

Are you serious? My God. I can't believe you are even considering it. I mean, that's hours and hours of dealing with them. I taught 1G/2G once, for a single term, and I saw them twice a week, for 40 minutes. And I had a co-teacher in there with me. And even then, I was SO glad when it was over. It was exhausting. You would be dealing with endless stress and crisis and every time things have settled down something else would happen. Most of them can't focus for more than 5 minutes on anything, even coloring or videos. Those age kids don't even understand how to be in school yet.\n\nJust remember: 'early morning until 5 PM'...it's not teaching. It's daycare.\n\nI'd also love to know what constitutes 'really good' money in this case. Like, even 20K a month wouldn't be enough for me to deal with that. I had a subject teaching job on the table recently, I almost got it, it was 20K+ a month not including housing, for 20 teaching hours with really smart HS kids. Are you going to get AT LEAST that much at this job? Because you would be working MUCH harder than I would have been.",

As a result, many of the current admin staff will not have been around when I was there, and I would only exist to them as a name in their archives.\n\n2) Does General Science count towards Physics \"experience\"?\n\nI genuinely have two years of Physics experience, but this is by adding together the time taught at three different schools. If one fails to respond, I would fall short and need to rely on my General Science experience to edge beyond the required provable two years.\n\n3) Do these documents need to be stamped/signed originals, or are scanned email attachments sufficient?\n\nI am getting these documents made retrospectively, and, as I am no longer in Bangkok (where most of these employers are), I can realistically only receive them as email scans.\n\n4) Is the TEFL/2-year thing a deal-breaker? By that I mean, is it something that could legitimately kill a z-visa application stone dead, or merely one of those \"we'll see what we can do\" situations that can be worked around?\n\nClearly, there is a worse-case-scenario where I can't get the requested proof, as I cannot force these employers from 4-10 years ago to write these letters, or even respond to my emails - especially as I am making these requests",

Again, the Chinese Government only care about the previous step (i.e. the China Embassy's approval).\n\nEdit: Got Ninja'd by Dan's post while writing this, but it seems to conform with the above. He didn't skip a step, but STEP 2 was willing to accept a variation on the stated STEP 1 (i.e. solicitor, rather than public notary) and this was no issue for STEP 3 or STEP 4 who only care about the step that immediately precedes them.",

The FCO can check that solicitors stamp and signature against the database to ensure they're practicing law. As it's a certified copy of a document issued by a UK body (your University) they can legalise the document. You can then send that off to be legalised by the Chinese Embassy.\n\nFor the criminal records check, the FCO will only accept the original but this also needs to certified by a solicitor. Its a bit strange and my solicitor was a bit confused as to what to write. I simply had her say \"confirmed as original\" and signed/stamped etc that the FCO require. I took along a printout of the FCO legalisation offices' guidance for what they required to legalise each specific document. I found that the reason a solicitor has to do this is because the Scotland check document isn't signed and stamped by a UK official so the solicitor provides their stamp to say it's a real document.\n\nHope that helps.",

Then, at midnight, they would either beg for or threaten midnight favors. Sadly, those that wanted to help never were treated with respect. It would have paid off simply to refuse people who beg to help you.\n\nEach of the managers I knew, even the ones that seem nice, ended up being liars and cheaters. When they needed a favor, it was a personal favor to them. When it came time to ask for it back, they pretended the school or personally owed nothing.\n\nThe school is at bigger risk. The school promised they could get their students into Top 100 US News and World report schools, but then could not keep their promise. As a result, they were interested in inflating grades, etc.\n\nBecause I saw many illegal things happening, they could be reported to US schools that took their students. That would make sure that BONA's reputation would be so terrible among US colleges that there would be no point to business, because a transcript from them is worth nothing.\n\nI strongly recommend anyone not to work for them, as these people are liars, cheaters, and the business is failing. If they can not even pay medical insurance bills for a teacher with cancer, it says something about wanting to grow with the firm.",

The UK foreign office certifies the document, and the Chinese embassy authenticates.\n\nIf you are transferring to another job with your existing police check, maybe the rules are different.\n\nI used an apostille service in the UK to get my record check through the three stage process , at a cost of about £170, plus postage from /to China which cost £40. In total it took 5- 6 weeks - using EMS from China to UK, and 'airmail signed for' UK to China. A courier service from UK to China would have added another £40, I think.\n\nOn the birthdate /FEC mistake, this should not be a problem because your old school will cancel that FEC when you leave, and the new school will apply for a new one .",

By rights I think that's supposed to be cancelled as soon as the contract is over too.\n\nThe new rule that says you must apply for your new FEC within 30 days of its expiration is only for an existing employer that wants to continue employment. If you're changing employers - the new employer must reapply for another FEC - which means you need an authenticated police check (issued no later than six months ago) and an authenticated degree. That can take a month or so - plus the processing time by the FEB to issue your z-visa.\n\nIf you don't have your new employer already in place - then you can't even get the process started - although you should get your degree and criminal check authenticated as soon as possible to give yourself some time.",

All applications now, be it renewals, transfers or new applications are handled under the work permit card system. Your current FEC is academic in this regard. It will still need to be cancelled and the cancellation letter obtained but a new application for a work permit will have to be created by your new employer.\n\nFor this you will need to have an authenticated degree. The criminal record check at the moment is required to be authenticated only in certain provinces, however you will need the original certificate.\n\nAs correctly mentioned you can obtain a Chinese one which will be accepted provided you have two clear years of residence in China. The application for this is relatively straightforward if you have remained in one city, however expect roadblocks if you have exited China during this period or have moved around.\n\nGiven the time frame you have and the fact that Spring Festival is in the middle of this it is going to be very tight. Your biggest ally will be your new school. If they have the approval to issue work permit cards and you have the correct documents they should be able to liaise with your existing school if necessary to expedite the process.\n\nYou should be doing things in this order:-\n\n1) New job. 2) sign contract. 3) new school begins online WP application. 4) current school cancels existing FEC booklet. 5) provide new school with all required documents. 6) assuming WP application is approved move to new location without delay. 7) new school will obtain WP card and process new RP in new location.\n\nThe last stage is critical and needs to be done at least 30 days before its expiry. If beyond that you will have no choice but to exit China and reapply for a fresh z visa and sta",

I know people earning way more - I know a couple in GZ earning a quarter mil USD a year. I also knew that when i saw this thread, there would be some clam telling you to THINK PACKAGE. This phrase is code for I EARN NOTHING BUT I HAVE A SPARE ROOM. Screw package, go for the bucks. I recently recruited a couple (married) - thet earn 100,000 usd a year but have no free apartment - so they found their own - 800 usd a month, so much better thany uni supplied dive. Bottom line, your original inquiry - 10,000 - its too conservative -for every 10 foreigners in China 8 are earning rubbish - aim for the 20%",

I've been treated with a great deal of respect by management, staff, work colleagues, etc. in both schools that I've worked in. Fairly well behaved, incredibly friendly and enthusiastic students for the most part.\n\n2. I have always been paid in full and on time, inc housing and airfare.\n\n3. Fully paid hols, 3.5 months.\n\n4. When I was very sick for two weeks, I was still paid a full month's salary and got medical costs refunded.\n\nI just hope that this continues and I'll happily stick at it for another year or two at least!

It depends on your agreements with them, and that you go in with your eyes wide open.\n\nMy first school was with Kids Castle, and they had my visa. Kindergarten school. The abused the contract and eventually I made a deal with them in order to be released (after 8 months). I could have avoided that if I'd done better research, but we're all very green coming over the first time.\n\nSince then, I've always had my visa with a university, and if I worked outside, I wouldn't trust the external school. There's no point signing a contract, never give your photo (or take publicity photos), and generally get paid on the date specified without any deviation. Anything dodgy arises and I walk, even if I'm leaving money behind.\n\nThe important part of China is to be independent. Public Universities, for the most part, hire and forget you. You've got the visa covered, and the university won't bother you much as long as the students are happy with you. Which is really easy to do.\n\nIn my time in China, I've worked for 17 language mills  . Most didn't have the license to hire foreigners, and only two tried to screw me. One tried to blackmail me, but since there was no paper trail, he couldn't prove that I'd worked for him, or received monies.\n\nI've also worked for 5 universities or colleges, and had no real problems with them, beyond the housing. Minor issues really. So, I only work for universities now.\n\nAs for resentment, I think it's important to acknowledge that China isn't that different from the West. You'll meet plenty of dodgy employers in the west, it's just that having a contract means so much more. The FLIP side though is quite often FTs are doing illegal work... That's worth remembering. That would put you outside of most protections in the West too.\n\nI have my own resentments/anger towards Chinese people from being here so long. It's natural. I just don't let the resentment show, and get on with my life. Overall, China is ",

        "content": "Getting close to my 10 year anniversary with China. I majored in Chinese at uni so came with a reason of learning. I have learned a lot, but not in that particular direction. I get on fine with people, not understanding this resentment/anger towards Chinese vibe. Occasionally, someone will be a jerk, but out of the billion and a half that is very small in numbers. I agree it can ruin a day/week/month, but that is not anything I see coming from Chinese people in general.\n\nI got baited on my first job. Met the \"boss\" personally in the US, but she had no clue how things worked where her sisters ran the company. Met my wife in that time (also 10 year anniversary coming) and she had a little bit on the game they were playing (she was not connected to the company, just general knowledge of how such companies work). That job ended swiftly, I said I cannot work for you, then I finally, after a few months of no work, found a stable job.\n\nMy previous job got me 9 years experience plus helping with development. The work environment changed and I was not so happy with how things were going. I was let go, and I think that was not the worst thing in the world. It caused me to scramble, as I have a wife and child, but never in need. I have good backing here now after all the years. Family, and yes, the Chinese family is my family, and friends are awesome help.",

The way they have treated me since the first time that I visited will stay with me for the rest of my life. Chinese people are great people from my experience bar the idiots that you will get in any country. One thing that is for sure, generally speaking, Chinese people have been (and probably continue to be in some cases) treated a lot worse in Western countries recently than we are in China!",

        "content": "Cheers to hear that others also have positive experiences in the land of the middle kingdom.\n\nI've shared some negative experiences around here in the past, but I have to say on the whole my experiences here in China have been solid, but that is a little bit because of luck and perserverence.\n\nFirstly, I'd say that people that have poor experiences here generally have them because they end up in the sticks or \"real china\" and they discover it isn't as mystical as the movies make it out to be. Living in a big city or the suburb of one is quite important because you'll be able to access first-world medicine, first-world food, and first-world education/educated folk. This will lead to less resentment towards the locals that may or may not treat you like a zoo animal.\n\nSecondly, I've gotten myself in a good situation with a lovely wife and a good job(s). This has made my experience a lot better. It saves me from having to go out all the time and hang out with folk that drink for a living. Those people are usually not here for the long haul so they'll make you not enjoy living here so much.\n\nThirdly, because my missus is now pregnant, I've discovered that having a little one is quite expensive so we've had to upgrade our living situation to be more accomodating for a little one. This has lead us to one of the fancier areas in the city that I could not dream of living in back in my hometown.\n\nA final point: my missus, her family, and my co-workers all have my back. I think having a good relationship with all of these people is paramount.\n\nOverall, I'd say China is what you make of it. If you want the good stuff (education, food, medicine, home), then you need to be willing to pay for it. After taking all of this in mind, I've been working like a madman, but it has been absolutely worth it. It grants me some happiness knowing that I have a wife and a little one or two that need me to provide for them and give them a good life. China has allowed me to have this so I am grat",
