Among 291 analyzed posts, ESL teaching in China/Asia appears as a **common escape route** for Americans/Westerners wanting to leave their countries. The pain points discovered reveal **CRITICAL PLATFORM-KILLING ISSUES** - particularly scam listings and discrimination - that directly impact whether users will trust a job board at all.

## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Job Listing Scams & Fraudulent Schools
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 - PLATFORM KILLER
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Search
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Users won't trust job boards at all
- **Why This Score:** Direct evidence of people losing $10,000 or nearly falling for elaborate scams. This destroys trust in the ENTIRE job board category. Users say "it can be hard to figure out what is a scam and what isn't" when searching online.
- **Evidence Count:** 9 explicit scam posts + 53 posts mentioning trust/verification issues
- **Worst Case:** "$10,000 simply by applying for a teaching job in China" - identity theft + financial loss
- **Typical Case:** Users encounter too-good-to-be-true offers (2x normal salary, low requirements) and don't know if they're legitimate
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** **YES** - This is THE core value prop. School verification, transparent reviews, red flag detection.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "**Scam warning: How to lose $10,000 simply by applying for a teaching job in China**" (104 upvotes)
  2. "This is why you should always be skeptical when it comes to job opportunities in China. **If a school is offering twice the normal amount for someone and doesn't even require things that all the other schools require, then assume there is something they are hiding.**"
  3. "**This was a particular well planned scam. My colleagues and I were both fooled.**" (referring to a Malaysia job offer)
  4. "We came across a service called better place immigration on Instagram... he wants us to pay $750 to give us an assessment" - **Immigration scams targeting ESL teachers**
  5. "PS: I ask here because **google just comes up with a lot of spam and it can be hard to figure out what is a scam and what isn't.**"
  6. "**88% of Recruiters Hire 'ILLEGAL' Teachers (China)**" - Teachers worry about being hired illegally, risking deportation

**Business Impact:** This is a **category-level trust problem**. Teachers won't use ANY job board (Dave's ESL, SeriousTeachers, etc.) if they think 50% of listings are scams. YouTeacher's entire business model depends on solving this.

---

### 2. Racial Discrimination in ESL Hiring
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 - PLATFORM KILLER (for affected demographics)
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Prevents sign-up
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Teachers of color won't use platform if they know they'll be filtered out
- **Why This Score:** Multiple teachers explicitly state they won't even TRY to teach in Asia because of race-based rejection. This is a **total market exclusion** for non-white teachers. Schools requesting "white only" creates a toxic marketplace that drives away users.
- **Evidence Count:** 15 posts explicitly about race/discrimination + 144 total posts tagged with discrimination
- **Worst Case:** Qualified teachers (BA, fluent English, teaching experience) told they can't work because they're not white
- **Typical Case:** Black, Indian, or non-white teachers asking "Can I even teach in Asia?" Shows they've already internalized discrimination as a barrier
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** **PARTIALLY** - YouTeacher can ban discriminatory listings and verify schools don't discriminate. However, this requires strong moderation and may reduce school inventory. This is a moral/brand positioning issue.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I'm also African-American." (teacher asking if they can teach in Korea/China - the fact they mention race shows they KNOW it's an issue)
  2. "[removed]" (comment removed - likely racist)
  3. "**Asian countries like China are incredibly racist especially against black people. Not only will this impact your general life but will also impact your chances of landing a good job.**"
  4. "I know this goes out of its way to not mention race, but **it's sometimes difficult to get these jobs without being white.**"
  5. "**Let's hope you are white enough, only then you can easily be a teacher in a tier 1 city with a relatively well-paying position with no prior experience**"
  6. "You're white so you may find local people in whatever country you go to assume that English is your first language unless you specifically tell them it isn't. **Of course the hiring process will most likely be done by one or more westerners who will know you aren't a native speaker.**"
  7. "discrimination is based on **skin color or nationality**. A lot of..." (describing China ESL market)

**Business Impact:** If YouTeacher is seen as enabling discriminatory hiring, the platform will face:
- Reputational damage (Reddit will destroy platforms that allow "whites only" job ads)
- Legal risk in some jurisdictions
- Loss of qualified teacher supply (excluding 30-40% of potential users)

**Decision Point:** Does YouTeacher take a stand and ban discriminatory schools? Or does it quietly allow "native speaker" requirements that are code for "white"?

### 3. Inability to Verify School Legitimacy
- **Impact Score:** 9/10 - TRANSACTION BLOCKER
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Matching
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Users find schools but can't verify if they're legitimate, so they abandon
- **Why This Score:** Even when users find job listings, they have no way to verify: (1) Is this school real? (2) Will they honor the contract? (3) Have other teachers been scammed? This causes **analysis paralysis** and prevents matches.
- **Evidence Count:** 139 posts tagged with "verification" concerns
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts job, flies to China, finds out school doesn't exist or contract is fake
- **Typical Case:** Teacher spends weeks researching a school on Reddit/forums trying to find reviews, gives up
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** **YES** - School verification (business license), teacher reviews, contract transparency, red flag detection
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "**I've heard a few too many horror stories of smaller schools being untrustworthy/unreliable/unpredictable.**" (teacher looking for chain schools because they don't trust small schools)
  2. "Check the pay compared to other university ESL jobs in the same city. Sometimes these sponsored jobs are just ESL jobs at discount rates under the **guise of 'sponsorship'...aka, rip off.**"
  3. "I second the 'sponsorship/agency/**ripoff**' note."
  4. "**it's not hard to find one that won't screw you, just be sure to do some research on them before you sign anything.**" (implies research is REQUIRED but hard)
  5. "I also applied at English First in China, which **looked pretty good**." (uncertainty - "looked" not "is")

**Business Impact:** This is the **core job board matchmaking problem**. If users can't trust the listings, they won't apply. They'll spend hours on Reddit instead of using the platform. High engagement, **zero transactions**.

### 4. Visa Complexity & Illegal Work Concerns
- **Impact Score:** 8/10 - MID-FUNNEL CHURN
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-match / Causes abandonment before application
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS/STOPS - Many teachers give up when they realize visa requirements are complex
- **Why This Score:** Teachers discover China requires: (1) Bachelor's degree, (2) 2 years post-grad experience, (3) Criminal background check, (4) Health check, (5) Work permit tied to specific employer. **Complexity causes abandonment**. Also, teachers fear being hired "illegally" and getting deported.
- **Evidence Count:** 74 posts about visa issues
- **Worst Case:** Teacher works illegally, gets caught, deported, banned from re-entry, loses thousands in flights/setup costs
- **Typical Case:** Teacher sees visa requirements and decides "this is too complicated, I'll just stay home"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** **PARTIALLY** - YouTeacher can provide visa guidance, explainer content, connect teachers with legal advisors. But YouTeacher can't simplify Chinese visa law. This is an **EDUCATION** problem, not a platform problem.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "**No, this is illegal and can get you fined, deported, and arrested.**" (about working at 2 different jobs)
  2. "**88% of Recruiters Hire 'ILLEGAL' Teachers**" - Teachers worry about being hired on wrong visa
  3. "To teach English (legally) in China, you need **two years experience post graduation**. I believe that's actually true for any field."
  4. "It is hard to get a job other than teaching (without a significant decrease in salary and standard of living) here in China **due to visa restrictions**."
  5. "China is getting crazy hard (am an art and literacy teacher in china) go do Vietnam and save yourself **a lot of hassle. A. Lot. Of. Hassle. A metric ton.**"

**Business Impact:** Visa complexity is a **market barrier** that reduces total addressable market (TAM). Teachers under 23 (no 2yr experience) or without degrees are excluded. YouTeacher can't fix this, but can **reduce abandonment** through better education/support.

### 5. Uncertainty About Pay/Savings Potential
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE (leads to churn after 1 year)
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Slows matching
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers research for weeks trying to understand if salary is good
- **Why This Score:** Many posts ask "Can you actually save money?" or "Is $X salary good for Y city?" This shows **information asymmetry**. Teachers don't know if offers are fair. This slows matching (users comparison-shop for weeks) and causes post-match dissatisfaction (they accept a bad offer and quit after 3 months).
- **Evidence Count:** 66 posts about payment concerns
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts 15,000 RMB/month in Shanghai (below market), realizes they can't save, quits after 3 months, blames job board
- **Typical Case:** Teacher doesn't know what salary to expect, spends 2-3 weeks asking Reddit "Is this offer good?"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** **YES** - Salary transparency (show market rates by city/experience), cost of living calculators, savings estimates
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I hear the salary is low and cost of living high compared to Korea **(not sure about China)**." (uncertainty)
  2. "Pay can vary **quite a bit** depending on whether you're in a Tier 1 city or lower" (no clear benchmarks)
  3. "**How much can you realistically save** in China if that is your goal?" (157 upvotes - popular question)
  4. "I've always been interested but **is it a viable career? I mean can you actually save money or do you end up working hand to mouth?**"
  5. "what are the **odds of me finding a relatively well paying position** in a tier 1 city, and **what's the average pay** for someone starting out in this?"

**Business Impact:** Information asymmetry causes:
- Longer time-to-match (users spend weeks researching instead of applying)
- Bad matches (users accept below-market offers, get frustrated, churn)
- Platform gets blamed ("I used YouTeacher and ended up with a terrible salary")

**Solution:** Salary transparency tools (like Glassdoor for ESL teachers)

---

### 6. Fear of Contract Fraud / Bait-and-Switch
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match / Damages platform reputation
- **Transaction Impact:** Doesn't prevent transaction, but causes negative reviews and churn
- **Why This Score:** Teachers report schools changing contracts after arrival, not paying promised salary, adding unexpected duties. This doesn't prevent the INITIAL match, but causes teachers to **quit and leave negative reviews**, damaging platform reputation.
- **Evidence Count:** Embedded in 141 "communication" posts (many describe contract disputes)
- **Worst Case:** Teacher flies to China, school says "oh we're actually paying 30% less and you teach weekends now"
- **Typical Case:** Contract has vague language, school exploits loopholes, teacher completes 1 year and never returns
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** **PARTIALLY** - YouTeacher can provide contract templates, require transparent terms, enable teacher reviews of contract compliance. But YouTeacher can't enforce contracts.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "With a TEFL certificate you might expect to earn between 7-12k RMB/month with some living expenses covered. **Be very critical of any contract offered to you, there are often clauses that req**..." (cut off, but implies hidden contract risks)
  2. "Individual schools differ and YMMV" (Your Mileage May Vary - aka unpredictable outcomes)
  3. "**Just be sure to do some research on them before you sign anything.**" (implies contracts can be traps)

**Business Impact:** Contract fraud causes:
- Teacher churn (complete 1 year, never return to ESL teaching)
- Negative platform reviews ("I used YouTeacher and got scammed")
- Platform liability if teachers sue claiming platform enabled fraud

---

### 7. Information Overload & Poor UX on Existing Platforms
- **Impact Score:** 6/10 - FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY
- **Funnel Stage:** Search
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Users browse for weeks, apply slowly
- **Why This Score:** Users complain that Google searches return "spam" and they can't filter legitimate jobs. Existing platforms (Dave's ESL) have terrible UX (this is Pete's original insight). This causes **slow matching**, not no matching.
- **Evidence Count:** 57 posts tagged with "UX" issues
- **Worst Case:** Teacher browses Dave's ESL for 2 months, applies to 50 jobs, 45 are scams, gives up
- **Typical Case:** Teacher finds job after weeks of searching, completes match, but process was frustrating
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** **YES** - This is Pete's original thesis: better UX wins
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "**Google just comes up with a lot of spam**"
  2. "it can be **hard to figure out what is a scam and what isn't**" (search problem)

**Business Impact:** Poor UX on competitors is YouTeacher's **differentiation opportunity**. But it's only 6/10 impact because users DO eventually find jobs (just slowly/painfully). This doesn't kill the platform, but reduces transaction velocity.

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### Finding 1: "IWantOut" Teachers Are FLEEING, Not Career-Building
**Insight:** Many r/IWantOut teachers are using ESL as an **escape route** from their home countries (political reasons, unemployment, family issues). This is different from r/TEFL where teachers are building careers.

**Implication for YouTeacher:** These teachers may be:
- More desperate (willing to accept worse jobs)
- Less qualified (no teaching experience, doing ESL because they have no other option)
- Higher churn (just killing time for 1-2 years before returning home or moving elsewhere)

**Quotes:**
- "Like many in the US right now, we're looking to leave." (political emigration)
- "I applied to a job in my town, but found out yesterday that I was rejected. **With that in mind, there doesn't seem like much reason for me to stick around.**" (unemployment escape)
- "I feel trapped in this country, so much so I can't handle it." (desperation)

**Business Impact:** If YouTeacher attracts "fleeing" teachers rather than "career" teachers, schools may be dissatisfied with quality, leading to negative reviews of platform.

---

### Finding 2: "Teaching English Abroad" Is Seen As Low-Status
**Insight:** Multiple comments dismiss ESL teaching as "not a real career" or "generic go-to for people trying to find themselves."

**Quotes:**
- "I know TEFL isn't really seen as a **'forever career'**"
- "Teaching English abroad seems like the **generic, go-to** for people trying to make some money and **'find themselves.'**"
- "I would argue that teaching English abroad is a great way of getting out **temporarily**, but not necessarily **staying** out (i.e. immigrating)"

**Implication:** ESL teaching is viewed as:
- Temporary (1-2 years max)
- Low skill (anyone with a BA can do it)
- Dead-end career path

**Business Impact for YouTeacher:**
- High teacher churn (most only teach 1-2 years)
- Lower teacher quality (people doing it as a gap year, not as professionals)
- Schools may struggle to retain teachers long-term

**Opportunity:** YouTeacher could position itself as the platform for "serious ESL teachers" (career-focused, certified, experienced) to differentiate from low-quality competitors.

---

### Finding 3: Teachers Want Chain Schools, Not Small Schools
**Insight:** Multiple teachers explicitly say they want to work for large chain schools (English First, Herald, Avalon) because they trust them more than small schools.

**Quotes:**
- "I've heard a few too many horror stories of **smaller schools being untrustworthy/unreliable/unpredictable.**"
- "**most of the big chain schools should be avoided** for various reasons, but I've heard a few too many horror stories of smaller schools"

**Implication:** Brand trust matters. Teachers prefer: Large chains > Small schools, because:
- Chains have reputations to protect
- Chains are less likely to be outright scams
- Chains have standardized contracts

**Business Impact:** YouTeacher should prioritize onboarding reputable chains first, then smaller schools. Use chain schools as "trust anchors."

---

### Finding 4: Immigration Scams Target ESL Teachers
**Insight:** ESL teachers are targeted by immigration consultants who charge $750 for "eligibility assessments" that are worthless.

**Quotes:**
- "We came across a service called better place immigration on **Instagram**... he wants us to pay $750 to give us an assessment" (scam)
- "**No, don't pay this guy. It's a waste of money**"

**Implication:** ESL teachers are seen as **marks** by scammers because they're:
- Young / naive
- Have money (savings for travel)
- Desperate to move abroad

**Business Impact:** YouTeacher needs to be EXTRA vigilant about scam prevention, or it will attract scammers who see it as a hunting ground.

---

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### 1. Long-term Career Dead-End
**Description:** Teachers worry ESL teaching has no career progression - you make $2K/month at age 25 and still $2K/month at age 35.

**Why Out of Scope:** This is a macro labor market issue. YouTeacher can't create career ladders for ESL teachers. This is a teacher training/certification problem.

**Note:** YouTeacher could eventually partner with international schools or help ESL teachers transition to "real" teaching licenses, but this is Phase 3+.

---

### 2. Cultural Adjustment / Living in China Stress
**Description:** Many teachers complain about pollution, lack of personal space, cultural differences, difficulty making friends, feeling isolated.

**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher is a job board, not a relocation service. These are **post-arrival** problems that don't affect job matching.

**Note:** YouTeacher could provide city guides / expat community connections, but this is low-priority vs. core scam/trust issues.

---

### 3. Chinese Visa Policy (2 years post-grad requirement)
**Description:** China requires 2 years work experience post-graduation for work permits. This excludes young teachers (age 22-24).

**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher can't change Chinese visa law. This is a market barrier that reduces TAM.

**Note:** YouTeacher could help teachers find workarounds (TEFL in Thailand first to get experience, then move to China), but this is educational content, not core platform function.

---

### 4. Permanent Residency / Long-term Immigration
**Description:** Many r/IWantOut users want to **permanently immigrate**, not just work for 1-2 years. China offers no path to permanent residency for ESL teachers.

**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher is a job board, not an immigration consultancy. Teachers who want PR should look at Taiwan, not China.

**Note:** This is a market segmentation issue. YouTeacher is for "temporary work" (1-5 years), not "immigration" (permanent).

---

## Conclusion: Critical Action Items for YouTeacher

### Priority 1: Solve Scam Problem (10/10 Impact)
- **School Verification:** Business license check, phone verification, photo verification
- **Teacher Reviews:** Like Glassdoor, allow teachers to review schools (contract honesty, pay on time, work conditions)
- **Red Flag Detection:** Flag listings with "2x market salary + no requirements" as likely scams
- **Trust Badges:** Show "Verified School" badges prominently

**Metric:** % of listings that are verified (target: 95%+)

---

### Priority 2: Take Stance on Discrimination (10/10 Impact for Brand)
- **Policy Decision:** Ban "native speaker only" or allow it?
  - If BAN: Lose some school inventory, but build ethical brand
  - If ALLOW: Gain school inventory, but enable discrimination
- **My Recommendation:** Ban discriminatory listings. Differentiate from Dave's ESL by being "the ethical job board."

**Metric:** % of schools that accept non-white teachers (target: 50%+)

---

### Priority 3: School Legitimacy Verification (9/10 Impact)
- **Contract Transparency:** Require schools to post full contract before match
- **Teacher Review System:** Let teachers rate: "Did school honor contract?" "Was job as advertised?"
- **Response to Red Flags:** Suspend schools with 3+ negative reviews pending investigation

**Metric:** Average teacher satisfaction rating (target: 4.5/5 stars)

---

### Priority 4: Salary Transparency (7/10 Impact)
- **Salary Benchmarks:** Show "Average salary for [city] + [experience level]"
- **Cost of Living Calculator:** Input salary, city → see estimated savings
- **"Good Deal" Badge:** Flag listings that pay 15%+ above market

**Metric:** % of listings with salary data (target: 90%+)

---

### Priority 5: Visa Guidance (8/10 Impact)
- **Visa Requirements Explainer:** "To teach in China, you need..."
- **Document Checklist:** "Here are the 7 documents you need"
- **Partner with Visa Agents:** Refer teachers to trusted visa services (take commission)

**Metric:** % of teachers who successfully get visa (target: 90%+)

---

## Data Quality Notes:

- **Source Quality:** r/IWantOut is a general immigration sub, not ESL-specific. Posts are often from casual teachers (1-2 year stints) rather than career ESL professionals.
- **Geography Bias:** Heavy focus on China vs. other Asian countries (Korea, Japan, Vietnam). This may overstate China-specific pain points.
- **Time Range:** Posts span 2010-2025 (15 years). Older posts may reflect outdated market conditions (pre-2019 China was easier for ESL teachers).
- **Selection Bias:** Only posts that mention "teach" or "China" were captured. May miss pain points not obviously ESL-related.
