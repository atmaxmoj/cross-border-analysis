## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Scam Job Listings & Fraudulent Recruiters
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 (PLATFORM KILLER)
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform & Search
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops transaction entirely + destroys platform trust
- **Why This Score:** Teachers explicitly state "I'll never use [platform] again" after scam experiences. Scams cause complete loss of trust in job boards as a discovery mechanism. Teachers lose thousands of dollars, uproot their lives, and get deported. Even one bad experience shared publicly can prevent hundreds of sign-ups. Evidence shows teachers warning others to "AVOID" specific schools found through platforms like Dave's ESL Cafe. This is existential for a job board business.
- **Evidence Count:** 129 posts explicitly mention scams/fraud
- **Worst Case:** Teacher nearly uprooted entire life for fake €5k/month Germany position found through established job board; lost time researching, planning, and almost sent sensitive documents
- **Typical Case:** Teachers find job listings through platforms like Dave's ESL Cafe, engage in lengthy email exchanges, sometimes fly out to destination, only to discover fraud (fake contracts, identity theft attempts, recruitment fee scams)
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is our core differentiation opportunity. Verification systems, reputation tracking, escrow payments, and transparent school histories can directly address this. This pain point JUSTIFIES YouTeacher's existence.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I was really close to uprooting my life, and you folks who called BS saved my butt." (Scam job found through established platform, score: 95, 33 comments)
  2. "I found it through a stickied post of the [Dave's ESL] Café, so I really want to believe that it's real... Alex has offered me the job, but says that once I receive the acceptance letter, I'm required to pay a part of the certification fees." (Score: 5, 11 comments - top comment: "Never pay for a job. scam!")
  3. "One of the biggest problems with the TEFL industry is that it is completely unregulated and, thus, is full of sharks only too willing to prey on and exploit new and would-be teachers." (Score: 113, 68 comments)
  4. "Some years ago, an American friend of mine... received a very tempting job ad about an amazing opportunity to teach English in Sunny Spain. They would throw in a CELTA course... there was a recruitment fee... I think they were asking her to pay for the Spanish attorney to arrange her visa!" (Top comment on scam warning post)
  5. "WARNING: online TEFL course scammers and shills... people sign up to the first online TEFL course they find, hand over their hard-earned cash and end up completely unprepared for the classroom, and with a certificate that's as good as useless." (Score: 113)

### 2. Illegal Employment & Visa Fraud by Schools
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 (PLATFORM KILLER)
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (but damages platform reputation permanently)
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops future transactions + creates massive liability
- **Why This Score:** Schools hire teachers without proper work permits, exposing teachers to deportation, legal consequences, and financial ruin. When a platform facilitates matches that lead to illegal work, teachers blame the platform and share warnings publicly. This creates viral negative content ("AVOID [school] - they made me work illegally"). Platform gets associated with illegal activity. Business risk extends beyond reputation - potential legal liability.
- **Evidence Count:** 331 posts mention visa/legal issues (many involve schools knowingly hiring illegal workers)
- **Worst Case:** Shane English School Thailand systematically employed teachers illegally, withheld work permits and original documents, didn't pay taxes, threatened teachers reporting violations with "immigration connections," and forced positive reviews as condition of references
- **Typical Case:** Schools promise work permit "soon" but keep teachers working on tourist visas for months; when caught, teacher faces deportation and school abandons them; teacher loses money, time, and gains criminal record
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Verify schools' legal compliance, track history of visa issues, require proof of work permit processing, create escrow/accountability for visa promises. Flag schools with patterns of illegal employment.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "The majority of people are working there illegally, without work permits or any teaching qualifications. The income tax they deduct from your wages is not paid to the Thai Government... They keep hold of your work permits at all times and original copies of your degree... HR have threatened various members of staff for defamation... Teachers are afraid to speak out due to the schools 'connections with immigration.'" (Shane English School Thailand, Score: 170, 37 comments)
  2. "Can confirm. I have a coworker who worked for these jokers. He said they are a scam company, everyone is illegal." (Comment confirming Shane English, score: 51)
  3. "It has recently come to our attention that a recruitment officer for TD Education has been sending our members unsolicited 'offers' to work in China... the false promise of providing a PU Letter (all but impossible right now)" (Moderator warning about unethical recruiter, Score: 99, 16 comments)
  4. "[Vietnam] By now, it can be quite uncertain, expensive, and time-consuming... It can take many months, or in my case, an entire year thanks to how much they have been changing the rules... my application was rejected despite having been submitted three weeks before a new rule was made" (Score: 76, 111 comments)
  5. "After spending hundreds re-upping on documents that needed multiple renewals... and hundreds more on visa extensions... I'd had enough. Last week, I left forever to go back to the US... I didn't want to lose any more money just trying to work in Vietnam." (Post-match failure due to visa complexity)

### 3. Contract Violations & Non-Payment
- **Impact Score:** 9/10 (TRANSACTION BLOCKER)
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (but prevents future transactions)
- **Transaction Impact:** Completes one transaction but teacher churns permanently and warns others publicly
- **Why This Score:** Teachers complete the match through platform but then get burned by non-payment or contract violations. They publicly post "AVOID [school]" warnings, directly naming the school and often the platform where they found it. Each incident creates permanent negative content that prevents future matches. From business perspective: lost LTV of churned teacher + prevented acquisitions from viral warnings.
- **Evidence Count:** 31 posts about contract breaches/non-payment
- **Worst Case:** Giraffe English refused to pay January salary for completed work during COVID, left teachers unable to afford food/rent, some evicted, teachers stranded in China unable to buy tickets home, company simultaneously posted new job listings to replace unpaid teachers
- **Typical Case:** School violates contract terms (salary, housing allowance, hours), teacher has no recourse, loses money, posts public warning to avoid school/platform
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Escrow payment systems, transparent contract tracking, reputation/review systems showing payment history. Cannot force schools to pay, but can make non-payment visible and discourage bad actors from using platform.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "They ended up refusing to pay us for January's salary, work already done before the epidemic... many of my coworkers have been evicted and are now homeless here in China because Giraffe English doesn't care about their employees... now Giraffe is posting job listings online to replace the teachers they have thrown under the bus. PLEASE AVOID Giraffe English at all costs for you do not and will never matter to them." (Score: 73, 69 comments)
  2. "There is no way I'd accept not being paid for work I'd already done, but neither would I hang around hoping to be paid... I'd cut my losses" (Top comment, score: 18 - shows teachers abandon market after non-payment)
  3. "Why does this always seem to be an issue in China? I'm about to finish my degree and work on my TEFL certification, and I never plan on teaching in China because of all the horror stories I hear about it." (Comment showing how public warnings prevent new teacher entry, score: 13)
  4. "The owner breaks the golden rule - 'don't mess with peoples pay, pay what you owe'... There are multiple glassdoor reviews from different years that will tell you he does this." (3Lions Krakow warning, Score: 2)

### 4. School/Recruiter Ghosting
- **Impact Score:** 8/10 (MID-FUNNEL CHURN)
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching/Application
- **Transaction Impact:** High engagement but zero transaction completion
- **Why This Score:** Teachers invest heavily (interview prep, demo lessons, documentation, relocation planning, sometimes flying to destination) but then schools/recruiters ghost. Teacher abandons platform believing it's full of non-serious employers. From business perspective: high cost to acquire engaged user, but zero revenue from match. If pattern repeats, teacher churns entirely.
- **Evidence Count:** 9 posts explicitly about ghosting
- **Worst Case:** Teacher flew to Bangkok, paid for accommodation and flights ($1000s), school recruited them then went completely silent, no communication even after teacher arrived in country, school then sent aggressive blame emails, teacher lost all money and left Thailand permanently
- **Typical Case:** Teacher completes interview, receives job offer, accepts within timeframe, then recruiter/school stops responding to emails about start date, orientation, visa, housing
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Verified communication SLAs, response time tracking, escrow-based commitments (school pays deposit upon offer that's forfeited if they ghost), reputation scores that penalize ghosting patterns
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "They recruited me and I flew in and paid for a few weeks accommodation on my own dime along with the flight. Cost me a lot of money. I arrived about 4 days before starting... I didn't receive any communication from them. Reached out to remind them of my arrival. No response... I lost a ton of money due to this endeavour. Wouldn't go to teach in Thailand again I think. Neither would I recommend it." (Score: 29, 25 comments)
  2. "I had an interview with the HR manager... she sent me all the school info, payment details, visa information, and told me I had 48 hours to accept. I accepted within the timeframe. Since then… crickets... Today is now Monday (so 4 days after) and I've sent a few follow-up emails asking about orientation, visa stuff, housing, banking, etc. No response at all. The term starts next week and I'm already in Bangkok" (Score: 10, 12 comments)
  3. "I have these interviews that go fairly well, and then I am asked to prepare a demo. I do that, submit, and then... nothing. They don't respond to my emails or wechats at all. This has happened to me three or four times since the start of the year." (Job Interview Burnout - China demos, Score: 17, 33 comments)
  4. "Ghosting is the cowards way out and becoming increasingly widespread." (Top comment on ghosting post, score: 3)
  5. "Your urgency is completely justified. Do not put your life on hold for them. I would immediately begin applying to other schools" (Comment showing teachers learn to distrust platforms)

### 5. Hidden Information & Misleading Job Descriptions
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 (POST-MATCH FAILURE)
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match
- **Transaction Impact:** Match completes but fails within weeks/months, creates negative reviews
- **Why This Score:** Teachers accept jobs based on platform listings, arrive to discover reality completely different (costs, accommodation quality, working conditions, actual hours, hidden fees). Teacher quits within months, posts warnings, blames platform for hosting misleading listings. Platform develops reputation for unreliable information.
- **Evidence Count:** 53 posts about "things no one tells you" and misleading information
- **Worst Case:** Teacher moves to China expecting modern apartments "for a steal" and manageable startup costs based on job board descriptions; reality is 3 months rent + 1 month deposit upfront, WiFi not included, apartments poorly maintained, startup costs much higher than disclosed
- **Typical Case:** Job listing omits critical details (startup costs, actual apartment quality, required self-funded expenses, additional unpaid hours), teacher discovers after commitment
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Standardized job templates requiring disclosure of ALL costs, verified photos of actual accommodation, teacher reviews of accuracy of listings, penalty system for misleading posts
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "The start up costs in the first 1-2 months of China is more than people tell you... All those posts from people bragging about fancy, modern apartments for a steal of the price. Not the reality... In my experience if you have to find an apartment yourself, it's hard to find an apartment with no problems or wear and tear Unless you have a very very high paying job." (Score: 53, 65 comments)
  2. "I'm literally just finding out both of those things this week lol, I just moved here. It's a real culture shock, especially looking at how bad and expensive some apartments are (nothing like BKK condos)... it's common for many landlords to ask for 3 months rent plus 1 month deposit" (Top comment, score: 16)
  3. "I read about moving to China EXTENSIVELY, and no one ever mentioned the fact that you have to work extra days some weekends to make up for public holidays" (Comment showing information asymmetry, score: 12)
  4. "Staff are expected to lie to parents about their qualifications. There are teachers with no early years training, no degrees and some who were hired just a week before they started working with kids. This is insane and it's certainly not legal." (Bangkok Australian International School warning, Score: 46, 24 comments)

### 6. Working Conditions Leading to Burnout/Quit
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 (POST-MATCH FAILURE)
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match
- **Transaction Impact:** Match completes but teacher quits early, posts negative review
- **Why This Score:** Similar to misleading descriptions but focuses on workload/conditions. Teachers matched through platform discover unrealistic hours, toxic environment, overwhelming workload. They quit within months and post warnings. Platform's match quality gets questioned. High early-churn rate damages reputation.
- **Evidence Count:** 18 posts about toxic conditions, burnout, quitting
- **Worst Case:** Teachers hired at kindergartens with overwhelming class sizes (including screaming 1-year-olds), no teaching assistant support to "save money," unrealistic expectations, leading to mental health crises and early resignation
- **Typical Case:** Job listing shows "20-25 hours teaching" but reality is 40+ hours with unpaid planning, admin, and weekend events
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Require transparent hour breakdowns (teaching vs. admin vs. planning), teacher reviews of actual workload, flag schools with high early-quit rates
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "This week, to save money on TA and staff, they've combined students into two classes. The lower class is made up of a one year old who screams and throws my flash cards everywhere, some two year olds that can't sit still... I've told them that I'll quit... Am I overreacting about my school?" (Score: 38, 35 comments)
  2. "I have been teaching for a few months and I absolutely hate it. I knew that it was not right for me from the first day, particularly because I have a history of (diagnosed but untreated) mental health problems... I never have time off from this job. I work all day, then come home and plan lessons" (Score: 28, 31 comments)
  3. "I came to China without much money, thinking I'd be paid in September, but I didn't get my first paycheck until November. I was broke and stressed... [Later] I'm finally in a good place" (Burnout to recovery story, Score: 69, 27 comments)
  4. "Just wanted to share a warning for any teachers considering working at Little Koala International Kindergarten in Bangkok... it was one of the most toxic experiences of my life." (Score: 46, 24 comments)

### 7. Job Search Friction & Information Gaps
- **Impact Score:** 6/10 (FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY)
- **Funnel Stage:** Search
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows matching process, increases time-to-hire
- **Why This Score:** Doesn't prevent transactions but makes process painful. Teachers spend weeks/months searching, can't find reliable information, get frustrated. Eventually find jobs but consider it "despite the platform, not because of it." Reduces platform velocity and throughput. Teachers less likely to return for next job.
- **Evidence Count:** 26 posts about difficulty finding jobs, unclear information
- **Worst Case:** Teachers unable to assess which country/city to target because information is scattered, outdated, or conflicting; spend months researching before even applying
- **Typical Case:** Teacher can't easily compare salary vs. cost of living across cities/schools, doesn't know startup costs, can't assess school reputation, spends weeks manually researching
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is core product value: aggregated data, standardized formats, cost-of-living calculators, reputation scores, startup cost transparency, verified information
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I'm 28, Bengali American... I'm just not sure where to go and would appreciate advice. China: This was my first choice, but I'm confused about the current state of visas and whether it's even realistic... EPIK: I know the pay is pretty low... JET: Extremely competitive... HESS: I've heard mixed things" (Score: 14, 21 comments - shows decision paralysis from lack of clear information)
  2. "I saw one of these [country comparison threads] posted 6 years ago and thought an updated version might be useful. I need to move soon and would be interested to see the stats of other teachers and countries." (Score: 66, 68 comments - teachers manually creating comparison data because platforms don't provide it)
  3. "I just got a job offer through a recruitment agency, called Amelia English. I tried looking them up online but I can't find much info on them. Has anyone ever heard of them?" (Score: 19, 30 comments - can't verify recruiter legitimacy)

### 8. Platform Trust Issues (Existing Job Boards)
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 (PLATFORM KILLER - but for competitors, not us!)
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform
- **Transaction Impact:** Prevents sign-ups to existing platforms
- **Why This Score:** Teachers explicitly share that they found scams through Dave's ESL Cafe and other established platforms. The moderators of r/TEFL regularly post warnings about specific recruiters and courses being promoted on the subreddit itself. This shows existing job boards have lost trust. This is our OPPORTUNITY - the market is ready for a trustworthy alternative.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 posts directly about platform distrust, but dozens mention Dave's ESL Cafe and other platforms negatively
- **Worst Case:** Teachers trust "stickied" listings on Dave's ESL Cafe because of platform authority, nearly fall for scams
- **Typical Case:** Teachers find jobs on established platforms, get scammed, then warn others never to trust job boards
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is the entire business thesis. Build trust through verification, transparency, and accountability that existing platforms lack.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I found it through a stickied post of the [Dave's ESL] Café, so I really want to believe that it's real" (Teacher trusting platform authority led to scam engagement, Score: 5)
  2. "At /r/TEFL, we make it our business to educate would-be TEFLers and enable them to make an informed choice... Following the very unprofessional behaviour of a number of dubious outfits on this sub (all of whom have now been banned, along with their various alt accounts)" (Moderators actively banning scammers from subreddit, Score: 113)
  3. "It has recently come to our attention that a recruitment officer for TD Education has been sending our members unsolicited 'offers'... As moderators, we take our role in protecting teachers from unethical and possibly predatory recruiters very seriously" (Platform moderation struggling to combat scammers, Score: 99)

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### 1. **Network Effects Work Against Victims**
The viral nature of warnings ("AVOID [school]" posts) creates permanent negative content that damages both schools AND platforms that hosted the listings. Teachers specifically name where they found scam jobs (Dave's ESL Cafe, Reddit posts, recruiters). This suggests:
- **Opportunity:** YouTeacher needs proactive scam prevention (verification BEFORE listing goes live), not just reactive moderation
- **Risk:** One viral "I got scammed on YouTeacher" post could kill the platform

### 2. **Trust Gap Creates Community-Based Job Discovery**
Teachers don't trust platforms, so they rely on r/TEFL megathreads, personal recommendations, and manual research. The "Country Comparison Mega thread" (66 upvotes, 68 comments) shows teachers manually crowd-sourcing data that should be platform features.
- **Opportunity:** YouTeacher can aggregate this crowd-sourced wisdom into structured, searchable data

### 3. **Visa/Legal Complexity Is a Massive Barrier**
331 posts mention visa issues - this is the #1 volume category. The complexity scares teachers away from entire countries (Vietnam post-COVID, China's changing rules). Teachers spend hundreds/thousands of dollars on failed visa attempts.
- **Opportunity:** Visa guidance/tracking as core feature. Schools that help with visas successfully become premium listings.
- **Challenge:** Visa regulations change frequently; requires ongoing maintenance

### 4. **"Things No One Tells You" = Information Asymmetry**
Multiple highly-engaged posts are literally titled "Things no one tells you about [country]." This shows existing platforms fail at basic information transparency.
- **Opportunity:** Standardized "Total Cost of Relocation" calculators, "Hidden Costs" sections, "Actual Working Hours" breakdowns

### 5. **Moderator Burden Shows Platform Governance Is Hard**
r/TEFL moderators actively ban scammers, write warnings, maintain wikis, and still can't keep up. They explicitly state platforms are "unregulated" and "full of sharks."
- **Lesson:** YouTeacher needs AUTOMATED verification systems, not just human moderation. Cannot scale on human review alone.

---

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### 1. **General TEFL Market Conditions**
- **Pain Point:** COVID decimated hiring, countries changing visa rules unpredictably, entire markets declining (Vietnam post-COVID, China crackdowns)
- **Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher cannot control macro policy or pandemic impacts. Can only provide transparency about current conditions.
- **Note for Awareness:** Need real-time data on which markets are actually hiring vs. which are dead

### 2. **Cultural Adaptation & Isolation**
- **Pain Point:** "Strange gatekeeping of foreigners in China" (58 upvotes) - teachers feel isolated, struggle with belonging, awkward foreigner interactions
- **Why Out of Scope:** This is post-relocation experience, not job board concern. Cannot solve cultural fit through matching algorithm.
- **Note for Awareness:** Could add "Expat Community" info to city pages as value-add

### 3. **Teacher Quality & Preparation**
- **Pain Point:** Many posts about unqualified teachers ruining market ("backpacker types for whom a job teaching English isn't a serious form of work")
- **Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher is supply-side constrained (need teachers). Cannot aggressively filter teachers without reducing supply.
- **Note for Awareness:** Schools care deeply about this. Could be premium feature (verified credential checking for serious teachers)

### 4. **Classroom Management & Teaching Skills**
- **Pain Point:** "I suck major peen; I feel like the kids aren't engaged half the time" - new teachers struggling with actual teaching
- **Why Out of Scope:** Professional development, not job discovery. Post-hire issue.
- **Note for Awareness:** Could partner with TEFL course providers for referral revenue

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Quantify Scale:** Analyze how many teachers are actually affected (1,506 posts is signal, but what's total r/TEFL audience?)
2. **Prioritize Solutions:** Map each pain point to specific product features (e.g., "Scam Prevention" → school verification workflow, escrow payments, review systems)
3. **Competitive Research:** Deep-dive Dave's ESL Cafe, SeriousTeachers.org to understand WHY they haven't solved these problems (tech limitation? business model misalignment?)
4. **Build Trust Mechanisms:** Design verification, escrow, and reputation systems that directly address top 3 pain points
5. **Content Strategy:** Create "How to Avoid Scams" guides, visa checklists, cost calculators to rank in search and build authority
