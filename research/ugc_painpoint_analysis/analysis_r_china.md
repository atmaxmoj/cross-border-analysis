## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Contract Fraud & Payment Non-Performance
- **Impact Score:** 10/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match / Platform trust destruction
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops future transactions + destroys platform trust
- **Why This Score:** This is THE platform killer. Teachers who experience payment fraud or contract violations become permanently distrustful of ALL job boards and will warn others away. The damage extends beyond the individual to the entire marketplace's reputation.
- **Evidence Count:** 107+ posts/comments mentioning contracts, multiple detailed warnings
- **Worst Case:** Teacher not paid for entire first month, threatened with visa cancellation if they complain, forced to continue working or face deportation
- **Typical Case:** Contracts modified after arrival, salary reduced from agreed amount, payments delayed 2-4 weeks with excuses
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Escrow system, verified schools only, contract enforcement guarantees, payment tracking
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "When payday came on the first month they said that there was a mix up and the pay would come the next week. The next morning I did not show up for any of my classes. When they knocked on my door I told them that I was not paid so therefore I do not work."
  2. "If you've signed anything without a valid work visa, from another country, or without a lawyer present, chances are whatever you've signed is not a valid contract, and will more than likely not be honored."
  3. "They still tried to screw around with the contract when I got over there."

### 2. Recruiter/Agent Scams & Exploitation
- **Impact Score:** 10/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-match / Transaction blocking
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops transactions completely OR creates toxic matches that destroy trust
- **Why This Score:** Agents actively harm the marketplace by selling teachers to exploitative schools, taking large cuts of salary, and disappearing after placement. This creates a fundamental trust problem that makes teachers avoid ALL intermediaries including legitimate job boards.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple detailed warnings, experienced teachers calling agents "the fucking worst"
- **Worst Case:** Agent takes 30-50% of monthly salary or large upfront finder's fee, places teacher in illegal work situation, disappears when problems arise
- **Typical Case:** Agent sells teacher to school, negotiations impossible after signing, agent incentivized to hide problems
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Direct school connections, transparent pricing, no agent middlemen, teacher-school direct communication
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "If you've been hired by an agent / web listing, they're quite literally selling you to any school that will give them the most money. He will either take a large chunk of your negotiated salary each month, or a finders fee paid up front. That is the overreaching goal, to make money off you, nothing else, no matter what they say, it's only about money for them. This theme will be repeated. ***Agent's are the fucking worst.***"
  2. "No negotiations will take place after the agent has sold you. He's got his money, and the school will tell you it's out of their hands, you've signed a contract with an agent."
  3. "Many agents and schools who recruit online or overseas are hoping that you have no idea"

### 3. Illegal Work Visa Arrangements
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Transaction / Post-match disaster
- **Transaction Impact:** Blocks legal transactions, creates deportation risk, permanent bans
- **Why This Score:** Schools offering "work on business visa" or other illegal arrangements create catastrophic outcomes: deportation, 4-year bans, detention, criminal records. This destroys trust in remote job offers and makes teachers demand in-person verification before accepting.
- **Evidence Count:** 35+ posts mentioning visa issues, detailed deportation stories
- **Worst Case:** Teacher deported after 1+ year working, 4-year ban from China, detention for weeks, girlfriend relationship destroyed, career derailed
- **Typical Case:** School says "it's fine, work on business visa", teacher discovers illegality too late, faces constant visa runs, lives in fear
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Only list schools providing legal Z-visas, visa verification system, legal compliance checking, clear visa status indicators
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I found a job as an English teacher in China, and I had a business visa. Earlier, I had contacted a guy who helps with employment, and he told me that with this visa I could work... My employer also said: 'It's fine, just work with us!' [...] I was running away from the police in China. [Later detained and deported with 4-year ban]"
  2. "You're not legally eligible to teach English here. You might find a job but you run the risk of being exploited and being forced to leave forever if you get caught out doing illegal work."
  3. "Sorry, but if you're not a native speaker you cannot legally teach English in China. The agency is going to do some dodgy shit to get you a visa, which will mean you will be teaching illegally. If you get caught doing so, the consequences will be... bad."

### 4. Non-Native Speaker Discrimination (Blocks Legal Employment)
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Search abandonment
- **Transaction Impact:** Completely blocks qualified candidates from market
- **Why This Score:** Highly qualified teachers (Masters in TESOL, years of experience) are told they cannot legally work in China due to nationality. This creates market abandonment by qualified candidates and forces some into illegal work arrangements. For a job board, this means losing an entire segment of supply.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple posts from qualified non-native speakers asking if they can work
- **Worst Case:** Teacher with Masters in TESOL, 3+ years experience, told they cannot legally work, pushed toward illegal arrangements or must give up on China entirely
- **Typical Case:** European/Asian teachers with excellent English told "you can't legally teach English here as a non-native speaker"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Can list international schools that hire non-native subject teachers, provide clarity on legal restrictions, reduce wasted time
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I am a BBC (British-born Chinese) who can speak English and Mandarin fluently. I have a masters degree in TESOL, 120 hr TEFL and an ACT English certificate. I have around 3 years of ELT experience from my internships... I've received an offer at 12k rmb... It will be harder with your Asian ethnicity, even if you have a British passport and accent."
  2. "You can't legally teach English here as a non-native speaker."
  3. "I'm Ukrainian (so my English is not native obviously)... Is it legal to become English teacher as a non-native at all?"

### 5. Racial Discrimination in Hiring
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching / Mid-funnel frustration
- **Transaction Impact:** Blocks/slows transactions for qualified candidates
- **Why This Score:** Qualified teachers face explicit discrimination based on race/appearance. This doesn't completely block all transactions but significantly reduces match rate and quality. Creates negative word-of-mouth and platform abandonment by diverse candidates.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple direct mentions, awareness across community
- **Worst Case:** Black teacher quits within a year due to discrimination, forced to leave China for another country
- **Typical Case:** Asian or non-white teachers paid less, face explicit "white teacher preferred" requirements, parents complain
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Flag anti-discrimination schools, provide filters, be transparent about school preferences, create verified "diversity-friendly" school list
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I don't want to be rude. Do you mind sharing your ethnic? Frankly, skin color matters in China. If you are white and young, you can **give it a try.**"
  2. "I had a black coworker who went to teach in China. She didn't last a year before going to the Dominican Republic to teach instead."
  3. [Job post image context] "That's what my friend encountered today for applying an English teaching job in China" [Post about explicit racial discrimination in hiring]

### 6. Information Asymmetry - "How Do I Not Get Scammed?"
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Search paralysis
- **Transaction Impact:** Prevents platform sign-up, causes multi-month delays
- **Why This Score:** Teachers spend months trying to figure out how to distinguish legitimate offers from scams. This information gap prevents them from taking action and creates demand for a trusted platform. However, it doesn't permanently block the market.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple "how do I not get scammed?" posts, detailed guides created by community
- **Worst Case:** Teacher delays China plans for 6-12 months while researching, misses job opportunities, gives up entirely
- **Typical Case:** Teacher asks "how do I not get scammed?", receives contradictory advice, proceeds cautiously
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is core value prop. Verified schools, transparent reviews, clear red flags, educational content
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I would like to teach English in China. How exactly do I do this (without getting scammed)?"
  2. "I'm having trouble finding ESL teaching jobs in China that aren't scams on Dave'sESLcafe or on here. What are some good places I can look to find legitimate jobs?"
  3. "I've been meaning to write something like this for a while... lets do bullet points... [detailed guide on avoiding scams]"

### 7. Post-COVID Market Deterioration
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Market abandonment
- **Transaction Impact:** Reduces total market size, lowers teacher quality
- **Why This Score:** Multiple teachers report the market has gotten "worse" post-COVID - lower salaries, schools closing, fewer opportunities. This doesn't block individual transactions but shrinks the overall market and creates negative sentiment.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple mentions of market decline, salary reductions
- **Worst Case:** Schools closing mid-year, teachers losing jobs unexpectedly, increased competition for fewer positions
- **Typical Case:** Salaries down from COVID-era peaks, fewer foreign teacher positions available
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Cannot change market conditions but can help teachers find the best remaining opportunities efficiently
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "If people are saying it's 'worse' they might be referring to the premium salary that was inflated due to covid is coming down quite a bit."
  2. "people here on reddit say that post-covid China doesn't really cares about english foreign teachers"
  3. "Schools are closing more frequently due to low enrollment"

### 8. Verification & Qualification Confusion
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Application abandonment
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows down matching, causes application errors
- **Why This Score:** Teachers unsure if their qualifications meet requirements waste time applying to wrong jobs or don't apply when they should. This friction slows the funnel but doesn't completely block it.
- **Evidence Count:** Dozens of posts asking "am I qualified?" or listing qualifications
- **Worst Case:** Teacher pursues expensive TEFL certification that doesn't actually help their case, wastes months
- **Typical Case:** Teacher unsure which certifications matter, what schools care about, how to position experience
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Clear qualification requirements per job, qualification checker tool, guidance on what matters
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I'm trying to determine what a likely starting salary would be given my qualifications... Beyond doing the baseline TEFL certification, is there any tangible benefit to doing the longer (and more expensive) qualifications?"
  2. "Nobody in China cares about your merit list or published papers."
  3. "What exactly do I need to start this? Currently I know the following: - A University Degree... Native English Speaker... TEFL Certification... A Visa... Work Experience?... Background Check..."

### 9. Geographic & Tier City Confusion
- **Impact Score:** 6/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Preference misalignment
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows matching, creates suboptimal matches
- **Why This Score:** Teachers often target only Tier 1 cities (Beijing/Shanghai) without understanding trade-offs. This creates unrealistic expectations and slower matching, but most teachers eventually broaden their search.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple mentions of tier city preferences and confusion
- **Worst Case:** Teacher rejects all Tier 2/3 offers, waits months for Tier 1 position that doesn't materialize
- **Typical Case:** Teacher starts wanting only Shanghai/Beijing, learns about salary/visa differences, expands search
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Clear tier city information, cost of living calculators, visa policy differences, help teachers make informed trade-offs
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I was told that the situation is getting stricter for work visas for tier 1 cities so they mainly have clients from tier 2 and 3."
  2. "I'd be interested in teaching in Shanghai if possible, as that's where some of my Chinese friends are located, but I understand that could be more expensive given it's a large city."
  3. "I've had a couple of offers from kinda rural places, like one in a town near Chongqing. I think these kind of offers will be rare, as schools in those rural areas likely won't have the budget or the permission to hire foreigners."

### 10. Experienced Teachers' Warning Posts Create Fear
- **Impact Score:** 6/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Pre-decision
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows market entry, increases caution (which is partially good)
- **Why This Score:** Veteran teachers post detailed warnings that make prospective teachers fearful. This creates healthy caution but also may scare away qualified candidates entirely. Mixed impact - reduces scams but also reduces total market participation.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple highly-upvoted "don't come to China" or detailed warning posts
- **Worst Case:** Qualified teacher abandons China plans entirely after reading horror stories
- **Typical Case:** Teacher reads warnings, becomes more cautious, eventually proceeds with better preparation
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Acknowledge real risks but show how platform mitigates them, provide positive case studies
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "If you are thinking about coming to work (i.e. teach) in China. My short answer: [GIF of 'don't do it']... Now let me elaborate a bit. I've been living and working here for over seven years..."
  2. "Coming to China to teach English or the like. My advice... **If you can, save a little money, then come to China and find a job.** and again **If you can, save a little money, then come to China and find a job.** Things work much easier this way."
  3. "PSA: If you are a first timer in China, don't work at soulless ESL mills... if the requirements for the nameless ESL mills are not AT LEAST a bachelors degree and 2 years of related work experience OR a TESL certificate(120 hours), it's 100% a scam."

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### 1. **Visa Run Exhaustion**
Teachers working on improper visas must do "visa runs" every 3-6 months (leaving China and returning). This creates:
- Financial burden (flights to Korea/Thailand)
- Relationship disruption (cannot maintain stability)
- Constant stress about next visa run
- This is a symptom of the illegal work problem but deserves specific attention

### 2. **"Save Money Then Come Find Job In-Person" Advice**
Experienced teachers repeatedly advise: save money, come to China on tourist visa, find job in person, then return home for proper Z-visa. This suggests:
- **Total distrust of remote hiring**
- Belief that in-person verification is only way to avoid scams
- Creates barrier to entry (need savings for speculative trip)
- **Opportunity for YouTeacher:** If platform can provide remote trust equivalent to in-person verification, huge competitive advantage

### 3. **Legal Employment Creates Leverage Problems**
Teachers correctly employed face different problem: they're "locked" to employer because:
- Employer holds work permit documents
- Changing jobs requires new visa process + leaving China
- Some employers weaponize this leverage
- **Quote:** "I know how China essentially locks foreigners down in jobs and doesn't let them go - which is a huge scam really"

### 4. **Qualification Inflation Advice**
Community openly discusses "faking" two years of experience to meet requirements. This suggests:
- Official requirements don't match market reality
- Teachers feel forced to embellish to compete
- Creates ethical dilemma and potential verification issues
- **Quote:** "Two years work experience. You can easily fake that, but be sure to fake that. Did I mention you should probably fake that?"

### 5. **Medical/Special Needs Information Gap**
Teachers with medical conditions (diabetes, disabilities) have almost no information about:
- Medication availability in China
- School accommodation policies
- Insurance coverage
- Creates barrier for certain teacher segments
- **Opportunity:** YouTeacher could provide this information

### 6. **Political/Cultural Teaching Restrictions**
Foreign teachers can be fired for discussing human rights, democracy, Taiwan, etc. This is:
- Not a job board problem per se (it's a China system issue)
- BUT teachers want to know school policies upfront
- Transparency about school expectations could reduce post-match conflicts
- **Quote:** "Our teacher is being fired for teaching critical thinking and controversial social issues in China... he was warned not to talk about 'human rights', democracy in China etc."

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### 1. **General Anti-Foreign Sentiment / Xenophobia**
- **Pain Point:** Post-COVID increase in anti-foreign sentiment, teachers experiencing discrimination in daily life
- **Why Out of Scope:** This is a societal/government issue that a job board cannot solve
- **Note for Awareness:** May reduce overall market size, but individual schools/cities vary greatly

### 2. **Declining Language Training Market**
- **Pain Point:** Government crackdowns on private tutoring, online English platforms shutting down
- **Why Out of Scope:** Regulatory environment changes are beyond platform control
- **Note for Awareness:** Impacts market size but legitimate school positions still exist

### 3. **Teaching Curriculum Restrictions**
- **Pain Point:** Increasing restrictions on Western teaching materials, government-mandated Chinese materials only
- **Why Out of Scope:** Policy issue that affects teaching experience but not job matching
- **Note for Awareness:** May affect teacher satisfaction post-hire

### 4. **Personal Relationship Issues**
- **Pain Point:** Cross-cultural relationship conflicts, family pressure regarding marriage/children
- **Why Out of Scope:** Not a job board problem
- **Note for Awareness:** Does appear in context of "why teachers leave China early"

### 5. **Cost of Living in Tier 1 Cities**
- **Pain Point:** Shanghai/Beijing expensive relative to teacher salaries
- **Why Out of Scope:** Market condition, not a platform problem
- **Note for Awareness:** Can be addressed through transparency (cost of living calculators) but cannot be "solved"
