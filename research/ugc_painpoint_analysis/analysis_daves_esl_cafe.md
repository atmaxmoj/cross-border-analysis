# Pain Point Discovery Report - Dave's ESL Cafe Forum (China Job Discussion)

## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Unpaid Wages & Contract Non-Compliance
- **Impact Score:** 10/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (after platform facilitated connection)
- **Transaction Impact:** Platform trust destroyed + repeat usage blocked
- **Why This Score:** This is a **PLATFORM KILLER** for job boards. When teachers arrive at jobs (facilitated through job board/forum) and don't get paid for months, they blame the platform that connected them. The COVID-era "January wages still not paid" thread shows school refusing payment during lockdown, leaving teacher with no recourse except potentially losing release letter if they push too hard. This creates toxic word-of-mouth: "I found my job on [platform] and they scammed me for $3,000+ in unpaid wages." Platform reputation is completely destroyed. Teachers warn others to avoid all job boards entirely.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 direct posts, multiple implied references
- **Worst Case:** Teacher loses 1-4 months of salary (~$3,000-$12,000), cannot leave without release letter, stuck in abusive situation
- **Typical Case:** School withholds vacation pay, unpaid during COVID/breaks, salary delays of 1-2 months
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Escrow/payment guarantee system, school financial vetting, blacklist schools with payment history, legal assistance, connect teachers to labor arbitration resources
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I still havent been paid Jans wages. Ive been off work since the lockdown started in late Jan, and my employers said 'we cant pay you until the school reopens again'... now theyre not responding to messages. I don't wanna piss them off though cos I will need a release letter to work elsewhere." (Dave's ESL Cafe, May 2020)
  2. "Sounds like the money has disappeared. Don't waste money on a lawyer... You never know. I would be looking for another job." (Dave's ESL Cafe, May 2020)

### 2. Contract Fraud & Bait-and-Switch After Arrival
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (damages platform reputation)
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops future transactions (platform blamed)
- **Why This Score:** This is a **TRANSACTION BLOCKER** for repeat users. Teacher completes match through job board, arrives in China, then discovers massive contract changes: increased teaching hours (no salary increase), 100% higher deposits demanded immediately in cash, undisclosed health outbreaks on campus. While the initial transaction happened, these teachers become vocal anti-advocates who warn networks to avoid all job boards. The Peizheng College case shows systematic deception: contract agreed remotely, changed upon arrival when teacher has already spent $1,000+ on flights/documents and is vulnerable. Platform gets blamed for not vetting schools properly.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 detailed case studies
- **Worst Case:** Peizheng College - increased teaching hours (same pay), 100% higher apartment deposit demanded immediately, nanovirus outbreak on campus not disclosed, teacher left within 1 week
- **Typical Case:** Schools change contract terms after arrival, demand cash payments immediately before first paycheck, hide material facts about working conditions
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Contract verification system, pre-arrival contract locking (schools sign binding terms), collect teacher experiences/reviews, blacklist schools with bait-and-switch history, arbitration service
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "After I arrived there, the college wanted to change my contract and tried to increase my teaching hours (but for the same salary - no corresponding increase in salary!). The college seemed to think that changing already agreed contracts wasn't a problem." (Peizheng College, 2017)
  2. "The college also tried to increase (by 100%!) the 'deposit' I should pay for the apartment... The college staff pressed me to pay this much higher deposit immediately in cash, despite my employment contract saying my apartment deposit was due to be paid after I had received my first month's pay." (Peizheng College, 2017)
  3. "In the days before I arrived, the area around the college had an outbreak of the 'nanovirus'. Local health authorities investigated the outbreak and closed the campus for 1 week. If I had known in advance about these problems, I would have reviewed my travel and working arrangements." (Peizheng College, 2017)

### 3. Illegal Work Visa Schemes & Deportation Risk
- **Impact Score:** 9/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (blocks legitimate transactions)
- **Transaction Impact:** Binary choice: accept deportation risk OR refuse job
- **Why This Score:** This is a **TRANSACTION BLOCKER** that prevents legitimate matches. Teachers encounter schools/recruiters who cannot or will not provide proper Z visas, pressuring teachers to work on tourist visas. The "Teaching on a tourist visa is that bad?" thread shows teachers weighing deportation risk vs income need. Response is blunt: "It's illegal, and could see you deported." Once teachers learn that job offers requiring illegal visas are common, they lose trust in ALL job boards - believing platforms don't verify legal hiring capability. Creates existential fear: "Will this job offer get me arrested?"
- **Evidence Count:** 2 posts directly discussing tourist visa work
- **Worst Case:** Deportation, blacklist from China, criminal record, loss of career opportunity
- **Typical Case:** School offers part-time position without visa, or promises to "look into" visa but "not likely", teacher works illegally for months
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Verify all schools have SAFEA registration (legal authority to hire foreigners), automatically flag any job not offering Z visa, educate users on visa requirements, blacklist schools requiring illegal work
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I met with a school in Shanghai last week and they told me they had part-time position available, teaching 5 hours per week in the evenings and they can't get me a visa... The person that interviewed me knows that I'm on a tourist visa and wants to sign a contract with me next week. She says she'll look into getting me a visa but it's not likely." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2007)
  2. "It's illegal, and could see you deported. You can take your chances on that." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2007)

### 4. Visa & Document Authentication Complexity (Multi-Month Process)
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-match (causes abandonment) / Matching (slows transactions)
- **Transaction Impact:** Causes search abandonment before transaction completes
- **Why This Score:** This is **MID-FUNNEL CHURN**. The visa/document authentication process is so complex and time-consuming (3+ months) that qualified teachers abandon before completing applications. The "Steps I took for a new visa after moving out of province" thread shows: 7-week wait for notarized diploma, 2-3 weeks for state apostille, authentication at Chinese embassy/consulate. Users express frustration: "These visa laws... have turned me off of China for now." Authentication costs $100s and requires multi-hour drives on weekdays during work hours. Teachers give up: "I'm about 80% ready to give up on returning to China." Platform loses users who can't navigate bureaucracy.
- **Evidence Count:** 6+ threads focused entirely on visa/authentication confusion
- **Worst Case:** Teacher spends 3 months + $500+ on authentication, gives up before finding job, or documents rejected and must restart entire process
- **Typical Case:** Confusion about medical exam timing/location, notarization requirements, whether to do steps in home country vs China, 6+ week delays
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Step-by-step visa guide with checklists, timeline calculator, document service recommendations, FAQs addressing every common confusion point, employer accountability for proper visa support
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "This process took about 3 months for me to complete. The first step is to obtain a notarized copy of your diploma... It took 6 weeks for that to be delivered to the school. The registrar's office then had to make a copy of it, put the required statement on the back, and notarize it. With mailing time, the total time was 7 weeks." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2018)
  2. "Reading the threads on these forums have turned me off of China for now. Maybe in a couple of years when the visa requirements are crystal clear, I will consider going there. To me, these visa laws sound similar to the ones in South Korea." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2018)
  3. "I'm about 80% ready to give up on returning to China. If the goal of these new policies is to secretly keep out we foreigners, it's succeeding." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2017 - regarding authentication difficulty)

### 5. Chinese Criminal Record Check Bureaucratic Nightmare
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Job switching (retention/re-engagement)
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows/blocks repeat transactions
- **Why This Score:** This is **MID-FUNNEL CHURN** for teachers trying to switch jobs within China. The "Chinese Criminal Record Check Procedure" thread reveals this is "possibly the most frustrating part of any visa process I have ever gone through in 7 different countries and 16 years of teaching abroad." Multi-step process involving school reference letters, business licenses, police stations, notary publics, foreign affairs offices - with documents taken at each stage and not returned, requiring photos/scans as backup. One mistake = restart entire process. This complexity means teachers who want to switch jobs (platform repeat usage opportunity) often give up and leave China entirely rather than navigate bureaucracy again.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 detailed threads documenting step-by-step nightmare
- **Worst Case:** Teacher on 3rd attempt at process, each mistake requires complete restart, contemplating giving up on China entirely
- **Typical Case:** "Every step of the way the rules are uncertain, even your handlers won't necessarily understand it, and every place you go to takes what they need without giving it back"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Provide detailed step-by-step guide with photos/examples, translation help, connect teachers with reliable visa agencies, advocate for simplified process, help schools understand requirements
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "This is also possibly the most frustrating part of any visa process I have ever gone through in 7 different countries and 16 years of teaching abroad. Every step of the way the rules are uncertain, even your handlers won't necessarily understand it, and every place you go to takes what they need without giving it back, meaning if you or someone else makes a mistake at any stage in this complicated process, you have to do it all over again (UNLESS YOU TAKE PHOTOS)." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2020)
  2. "If your third attempt is not successful (I hope it will be) how many more times will you attempt doing this? It must be really frustrating." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2020)

### 6. Flaky Recruiters & Hidden Intermediaries
- **Impact Score:** 8/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search (causes frustration and wasted time)
- **Transaction Impact:** Causes search abandonment and distrust
- **Why This Score:** This is **MID-FUNNEL CHURN** that damages trust in ALL intermediaries (including YouTeacher). The "ESL jobs in China overrun by flaky recruiter and agents" thread reveals teachers can't distinguish legitimate school contacts from third-party recruiters. Teachers believe they're communicating with school HR, only to discover it's a recruiter "with no decision making in the hiring process at all." These recruiters hide their identity, waste teachers' time with fake interest, and damage trust in job boards. Teachers learn to distrust all platforms: "Teachers are going to realize that the ESL industry is in its death throes."
- **Evidence Count:** 2 posts discussing recruiter proliferation and deception
- **Worst Case:** Teacher spends months communicating with "school contact" who is actually powerless recruiter, interview process reveals no real school interest
- **Typical Case:** Recruiters pose as school employees, hide their intermediary status, collect resumes without actual placement authority
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Transparent platform showing direct school contacts, verify all school representatives, ban recruiters who hide their identity, clear labeling of any third-party recruiters, direct school-to-teacher connections only
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Job postings for jobs in China are now starting to become overrun with recruiters and agents. The problem is that they contact you and it is difficult to tell that they are flaky recruiters and not administrators or HR employees working for a specific school. So essentially you think a school is really interested in you, and it turns out that your wonderful hiring school contact is just a recruiter and has no decision making in the hiring process at all. These recruiters will not let you know or in any way let on to the fact that they are recruiters." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2020)
  2. "At some point teachers are going to realize that the ESL industry is in it's death throes. The above is one good example." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2020)

### 7. School Information Asymmetry & Verification Impossible
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Matching (causes hesitation and bad matches)
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows transactions, creates bad matches
- **Why This Score:** This is **POST-MATCH FAILURE** risk. Teachers repeatedly ask "Any info on [school name]?" and receive no responses or limited information. Examples: "Any info on sustech in Shenzhen?", "Beijing-Dublin International College" - anyone know anything?", "Has anyone got any fairly recent info on Dipont?" This information vacuum means teachers either (1) abandon opportunities due to uncertainty, OR (2) accept jobs blindly and quit when reality doesn't match expectations. Creates analysis paralysis and drives teachers toward "safer" options like going through personal networks instead of job boards.
- **Evidence Count:** 3+ posts asking for school information with no replies
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts job at unverified school, arrives to discover school is disorganized/misrepresented, leaves early
- **Typical Case:** Teacher can't find reviews or basic information about schools, makes decision with incomplete data, anxious about legitimacy
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Core platform feature. Verified school profiles with photos, location details, teacher reviews, contract transparency, response rate metrics, "teacher experience" scores
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I would like to hear about any info on Sustech in Shenzhen. Thanks." [No replies] (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2018)
  2. "This is a recent partnership between University College Dublin and Beijing University of Technology. They're looking for teachers for Sep 2014. Anyone know anything of this institute?" (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2014)
  3. "Has anyone got any fairly recent info on Dipont? Info on particular centres particularly appreciated. I'm looking to teach ESL/EAL." [No replies] (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2020)

### 8. Age Discrimination (60+ Hard Barrier)
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform (excludes qualified candidates)
- **Transaction Impact:** Shrinks addressable market
- **Why This Score:** This is **PRE-PLATFORM ABANDONMENT** for a specific segment. Teachers approaching or over 60 face a hard visa barrier but still get contacted by recruiters who apparently don't know the rules. The "I am 59 and recruiters are contacting me" thread shows teacher confusion: asked to spend "$100s on notarizations and certifications" with only months before age 60 cutoff when visa becomes "impossible" in most locations. This creates: (1) wasted time/money for near-60 teachers, (2) distrust of recruiters/platforms that list jobs they can't actually qualify for, (3) shrinks YouTeacher's addressable market. However, response reveals exceptions exist in some cities, adding to confusion.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 posts discussing age limits, 1 post explaining exceptions
- **Worst Case:** Teacher turns 60 while processing visa, application rejected, $500+ in authentication costs wasted
- **Typical Case:** Teachers 59-65 receive job offers but unclear if they can actually get visas, confusion about which cities allow exceptions
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Clear age requirement disclosure per job/city, flag jobs with age restrictions, connect older teachers to cities with exceptions, eligibility checker tool
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I am 59, US citizen, have an MA in TESL, and I am getting contacted by Chinese recruiters offering to get me a job. They are asking me to submit a video... also asking me to get my police clearances and my diplomas certified etc. Knowing that it is impossible to get a visa to work in China after 60 and I am going to be 60 in April, I wonder what they are on about. Don't they know the rules? Should I spent 100's of dollars on all these notarizations and certifications?" (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2019)
  2. "It's not impossible. It's nearly impossible in SOME places like Guangzhou, but there are MANY places where there are exceptions in place to this rule. Lots of teachers in 2nd and 3rd tier cities teaching after 60." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2019)

### 9. Release Letter Trap (Job Lock-In)
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (retention problem)
- **Transaction Impact:** Prevents future transactions
- **Why This Score:** This is **POST-MATCH FAILURE** that damages platform reputation. Teacher accepts job (platform facilitated), but when situation turns bad, they're trapped because current employer can refuse "release letter" required for next work permit. The "January wages still not paid" thread reveals this blackmail dynamic: teacher not paid for months but "don't wanna piss them off though cos I will need a release letter to work elsewhere." Teachers become stuck in abusive situations, resent the platform that connected them, warn others that "Chinese teaching jobs are traps."
- **Evidence Count:** 1 direct post, multiple implied references in visa transfer discussions
- **Worst Case:** Teacher in abusive/unpaid situation but cannot switch jobs without employer cooperation, forced to tolerate abuse or leave China entirely
- **Typical Case:** Teacher wants to leave bad job early but needs employer's release letter for next visa; employer refuses out of spite
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Educate users about release letter requirements upfront, contract language requiring cooperation, connect with SAFEA for dispute resolution, blacklist schools that abuse release letter power
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I don't wanna piss them off though cos I will need a release letter to work elsewhere." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2020 - in context of unpaid wages)
  2. "If your new employer is legit, I think they will need the paperwork to transfer your RP from your current employer... they require two things from your current employer, a letter of recommendation and a transfer form of some sort that basically says that you've completed your contract." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2014)

### 10. Suspicious Interview Practices (Security Concerns)
- **Impact Score:** 6/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (creates distrust)
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows transactions, creates hesitation
- **Why This Score:** This is **FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY**. The "Interviewer - log in with THEIR skype name & PW" thread shows schools making unusual requests (sharing Skype login credentials) that trigger red flags for teachers. While the likely explanation is technical (better connection in China), the suspicious request makes teachers hesitate and question school legitimacy. Creates distrust that slows matching process and may cause some teachers to decline opportunities.
- **Evidence Count:** 1 post showing confusion and distrust
- **Worst Case:** Teacher declines legitimate opportunity due to suspicious request, or accepts and unknowingly shares credentials with scammer
- **Typical Case:** Unusual interview requests (shared accounts, unconventional video platforms) create hesitation and require forum vetting before proceeding
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Provide verified video interview infrastructure through platform, establish interview best practices, flag unusual school requests, create trust through platform-mediated communication
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I have an interview with a school tonight. They want me to login with a skype account and password that they are providing. I have never heard of that being done before... Just wanted to hear your thoughts. Not sure if it is some scam." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2019)
  2. "There's no need to do that. I've done skype interviews with China and my account worked fine... On the other hand, maybe they're trying to do that for a more reliable connection." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2019)

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### "Ghost Town Forum" - Platform Decline Indicators
Multiple threads have zero replies or only 1-2 responses, even for urgent questions. The Chinese Criminal Record Check thread author notes: "This forum is a ghost town but if someone is looking for answers one day they might appreciate this story." This indicates Dave's ESL Cafe is losing active users and utility, creating an opportunity for YouTeacher to capture frustrated users seeking better information and community.

**Quote:** "This forum is a ghost town but if someone is looking for answers one day they might appreciate this story." (Dave's ESL Cafe, 2020)

**Business Implication:** Incumbent platform is dying. Teachers posting questions receive no answers, forcing them to take risks without community support. YouTeacher can capture this frustrated audience by providing ACTIVE community + expert guidance.

### Moderator-Heavy Environment Creates Chilling Effect
First 7 threads in dataset are all moderator warnings: "LENGTHY POSTINGS", "Hostility/Trolling/Flaming = Banned", "No Korea Focused Postings", "Address the Message and Not the Messenger", "Profanity Filter Violations", etc. Heavy-handed moderation with permanent bans and ISP blocking may be suppressing organic teacher discussions and creating hostile environment.

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher should have LIGHTER moderation approach that welcomes all questions (even if "annoying") to create safe space for newbies. Community-first, not moderator-first.

### COVID-Era Salary Theft Pattern
"January wages still not paid" (May 2020) shows schools using COVID as excuse to not pay teachers for months. This creates new category of contract fraud specific to force majeure events. Teachers have no recourse and are advised "don't waste money on a lawyer."

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher needs force majeure clause guidance, escrow systems, and legal support for teachers facing COVID-era (or future pandemic) salary theft.

### Medical Exam Timing Confusion (Chicken & Egg)
Multiple threads show confusion about whether to do medical exam in home country or China, and when. One post reveals if you do exam in home country, "you still have to go to the Beijing medical exam clinic to have the tests 'authorized'" - wasting time and money. This creates unnecessary friction.

**Business Implication:** Clear guidance on medical exam timing could save teachers $100s and weeks of delays. YouTeacher should provide city-specific medical exam timelines.

### "Contract Checklist" Community Demand
The "Job Offer Checklist" post attempts to create standardized contract evaluation framework, showing teachers desperate for objective comparison tools. Post lists 18+ questions to ask about any offer (housing, teaching hours, pay for holidays, etc.).

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher should build this INTO THE PLATFORM - automated contract analyzer that flags red flags, compares to market rates, highlights missing clauses. Convert manual forum posts into product features.

### 6-Month Visa for 1-Year Contract Scam
"Contract v. Work Visa" post reveals school giving teacher only 6-month visa for 12-month contract, with promise to "simply renew it again." This traps teacher into staying at bad job because visa expiration gives school leverage. Teacher wants to leave at 6-month mark (visa expiration) but contract says 12 months.

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher should flag any job where visa duration < contract duration as RED FLAG. Educate users this is tactic to trap teachers.

### Sticky/Resource Thread Strategy Failure
Multiple posts suggest making informative threads "sticky" to preserve useful info: "Why don't you make this a sticky?", "Maybe should be a sticky?" But forum structure doesn't support good knowledge management, forcing teachers to re-ask same questions every year.

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher should have KNOWLEDGE BASE with upvoting/search, not linear forum threads. Information should be findable, not buried in chronological posts.

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### Political Tensions & Arbitrary Arrest Fears
"State Dept Warning for U.S. Citizens" and "Two Americans detained in China on border charges" threads show geopolitical concerns. One recruitment company statement: "because of increasing political and economic problems between the u.s. and china, we are no longer able to send teachers to china safely."

**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher cannot solve US-China political tensions or arbitrary arrest risks. Can only provide transparent risk information and State Department alerts. Teachers must make own risk assessment.

### COVID-19 Travel Restrictions
"Universities remain shut but offer online courses" and "Leave China NOW - UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office" show pandemic travel disruptions.

**Why Out of Scope:** Force majeure events are unpredictable. YouTeacher can't prevent pandemics but can provide updated travel advisory info and help teachers navigate disruptions.

### Personal Packing Questions
"it is official" thread asking what to bring to China (deodorant, ear plugs, razors, toothpaste).

**Why Out of Scope:** Personal logistics are not job board problems. Can provide pre-departure checklist as supplementary content but doesn't affect platform transactions.

### IELTS Examiner Career Questions
"Full time IELTS examiner?" thread discussing British Council examiner positions - niche career path with specific credentialing.

**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher focused on ESL teaching positions, not IELTS examining. Different market segment. Note for future: could partner with BC if expanding scope.

### Language Learning Questions
"Returning to China- Guangzhou" post mentions Mandarin learning via Pimsleur CDs.

**Why Out of Scope:** Language learning resources don't affect job board transactions. Can provide links to language learning partners but not core platform feature.

## Key Insights:

### Dave's ESL Cafe = "Ghost Town" (Opportunity)
Forum is dying - teachers post urgent questions and receive zero or minimal responses. "This forum is a ghost town" comment indicates platform decline. Active users have migrated elsewhere, creating vacuum for YouTeacher to fill with RESPONSIVE community and expert guidance.

### Moderate-to-High Barriers = Frustrated But Committed Teachers
Teachers navigating Dave's ESL Cafe have already shown high commitment (willing to spend $100s on authentication, wait 3+ months for visas, navigate bureaucracy). These are IDEAL YouTeacher users - not tire-kickers, but serious candidates who will pay for platform value. They're desperate for better information and protection.

### Contract Fraud Pattern: Remote Agreement → In-Person Bait-and-Switch
Peizheng College case reveals systematic fraud: school signs contract remotely (teacher feels safe), then changes terms drastically upon arrival when teacher is vulnerable (already spent $1,000+ on travel, documents now in China with no backup plan). YouTeacher must LOCK contracts before arrival.

### Visa Complexity = Both Churn Risk AND Moat
Visa/authentication process is so complex it causes abandonment (BAD), but also creates massive value opportunity for YouTeacher to provide step-by-step guidance (GOOD). Teachers who successfully navigate with YouTeacher's help will be loyal users. Complexity creates switching costs.

### Release Letter = Hidden Contract Trap
Teachers don't understand release letter requirement until too late. Then trapped in bad jobs because switching requires current employer cooperation. YouTeacher must educate users UPFRONT and design contracts with release letter cooperation clause.

### Recruiter Proliferation = Trust Erosion for ALL Intermediaries
Teachers can't distinguish school contacts from recruiters, damaging trust in ALL platforms (including YouTeacher). Must provide RADICAL TRANSPARENCY - verify all school contacts are actual employees, ban recruiter impersonation, show direct communication with schools only.
