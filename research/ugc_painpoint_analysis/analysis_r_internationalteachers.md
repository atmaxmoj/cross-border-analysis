## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Racial Discrimination in Hiring (Black Teachers in China)
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 - PLATFORM KILLER
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform / Search
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Teachers can't complete transactions regardless of qualifications
- **Why This Score:** This completely prevents qualified teachers from using platform successfully. If a job board facilitates 100+ applications with zero matches due to discriminatory filtering, teachers will blame the platform and never return. Destroys trust in marketplace entirely. Schools openly advertise "White native speaker only" / "Prefer European appearance" / "No Africans" - this is a systemic barrier that stops transactions before they start.
- **Evidence Count:** 5 dedicated posts, 226+ upvotes on primary post, 228 comments
- **Worst Case:** Teacher applies to 100+ schools, gets zero consideration despite qualifications, wastes months of time, concludes "China is impossible for Black teachers"
- **Typical Case:** Recruiters reject teachers before schools see resume, saying "school doesn't accept Black teachers"
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Cannot fix school-side discrimination, but CAN:
  - Transparently flag schools that discriminate (verified through patterns)
  - Only list schools that commit to non-discriminatory hiring
  - Create verified "equal opportunity employer" badges
  - Help teachers avoid wasting time on schools that will reject them
  - Build trust by being honest about market realities
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I've held this in for a long time, but after applying to over **100 schools** in China with no real considerationâ€”not because of my qualifications, but because of my skin colorâ€”it's time to speak up."
  2. "What schools *really* want is spelled out bluntly in job posts: 'White native speaker only.' 'Prefer European appearance.' 'No Africans.' They're not even embarrassed to say it out loud."
  3. "Agents will ask you to send a video introduction. You do. You smile. You show your personality and professionalism. And the moment they realize you're Black, something shifts. You never hear back."
  4. "I've been in China for 5 years now... a lot of recruiters are saying the schools aren't accepting black teachers. My resume isn't necessarily the best but I'm being rejected before the school even looks at the resume."

### 2. School Contract Fraud & Non-Payment of Salaries
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 - PLATFORM KILLER
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (damages platform reputation)
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Creates platform liability and destroys trust
- **Why This Score:** When a job board connects teachers to schools that don't pay salaries, the platform gets blamed forever. This creates viral negative content ("I got scammed through [platform]") and prevents future sign-ups. Teachers trapped without salary for 2+ months face financial devastation, housing loss, and cannot leave due to contract terms.
- **Evidence Count:** 96 posts mentioning contract issues, 3 major school scandals documented
- **Worst Case:** Teachers work for months, receive $0 salary, trapped in foreign country with no income, school insurance cancelled, CIS certification lost, teachers organize work refusal
- **Typical Case:** 1-2 month salary delays, broken promises about payment dates, director lies repeatedly, teachers eventually paid partially or quit
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is a CORE DIFFERENTIATOR:
  - Verify school payment history before listing
  - Require schools to post payment track record
  - Create escrow system for first month salary
  - Ban schools with payment violations
  - Provide "payment verified" badges
  - Show teacher reviews about payment reliability
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "We currently have not been paid in full for January, we have not received our February salary, and we have not received our housing allowance. The board and director have been completely silent and have not even acknowledged the issue." (AISVN Vietnam - 90â†‘ + 117ðŸ’¬)
  2. "Here we are mid March and we still have not been paid in full for January, we have not received any of our February salary. We have not received our February housing allowance, and our insurance is still cancelled. The owner and director sent emails... made promises... only to find out days later that it was yet another lie." (AISVN Update - 98â†‘ + 68ðŸ’¬)
  3. "We recently lost our CIS certification, as a result..." (AISVN scandal continued)
  4. "Over 20 of my elementary cohorts didn't come to work. I am deeply hurt and tormented on what to do."

### 3. Information Asymmetry - Cannot Vet Bad Schools Before Accepting
- **Impact Score:** 9/10 - TRANSACTION BLOCKER
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (prevents informed decisions)
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS/SLOWS - Teachers accept jobs then discover red flags, creating post-match failures
- **Why This Score:** Teachers invest weeks in application/interview process only to discover critical red flags AFTER accepting. This creates high-engagement but failed matches. Teachers then blame themselves for "not doing enough research" but the information simply doesn't exist in accessible form. Community creates manual solutions (spreadsheets, warning posts) proving market failure.
- **Evidence Count:** 122 posts about school quality issues, dedicated vetting checklist post (112â†‘ + 63ðŸ’¬), multiple "nightmare school" warnings
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts job, relocates internationally, discovers school is "nightmare" with contract fraud, salary issues, toxic management, stuck for 1 year minimum
- **Typical Case:** Teachers hear about school problems AFTER accepting offer, through Reddit warnings, wish they had known earlier
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - This is THE CORE VALUE PROPOSITION:
  - Verified teacher reviews (must have worked at school)
  - School reputation scores (payment, contract adherence, management)
  - Red flag indicators (ownership changes, accreditation status, teacher turnover rate)
  - "Schools to Avoid" verified list
  - Integration with ISR-style review platforms
  - Transparent ownership/history information
  - Checklist automation (26 points from community vetting guide)
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "A common frustration we all face is taking time going through the application process just to find out that a school doesn't meet our expectations." (Salary transparency thread - 193â†‘ + 170ðŸ’¬)
  2. "Comprehensive Checklist for Vetting International Schools... a practical 26 point basis for teachers to cover all their bases when interviewing with potential schools" (112â†‘ + 63ðŸ’¬)
  3. "I recently left my job at a so-called 'international' school in China... far from the dream many of us are sold during recruitment. Leaving was a bureaucratic slog: checklists, signatures, surprise policy changes, veiled threats..." (Unwritten Rules post - 104â†‘ + 69ðŸ’¬)
  4. "What are instant red flags when applying for an international school?" (34â†‘ + 126ðŸ’¬) - Community desperately wants this information upfront
  5. "Pinned post on schools which ghost after an interview... ISR doesn't seem to be the place for it, and is better kept for teachers who have actually worked at a given school." (75â†‘ + 74ðŸ’¬)

---

### 4. Salary & Compensation Opacity
- **Impact Score:** 8/10 - MID-FUNNEL CHURN
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Matching
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers abandon after investing time in applications
- **Why This Score:** Teachers invest significant time (applications, interviews, even offers) only to discover salary doesn't meet expectations at final stage. Community created DIY solutions (live Google spreadsheet with 200+ schools) proving this is a market failure. This causes abandonment after high investment of teacher time and platform resources.
- **Evidence Count:** 2 major salary transparency posts (193â†‘ + 170ðŸ’¬ and 217â†‘ + 120ðŸ’¬), community-built Google spreadsheet
- **Worst Case:** Teacher goes through entire interview process, gets offer, discovers salary is 40% below expectations, declines, wasted weeks/months
- **Typical Case:** Schools hide salary until late in process, teachers frustrated they can't filter by compensation upfront
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - EASY DIFFERENTIATION:
  - Require salary ranges in all listings (or don't list the school)
  - Show total compensation breakdown (base + housing + flights + bonuses)
  - Salary comparison tools (by country, experience level, subject)
  - Integration with community salary data
  - "Verified compensation" badges for transparent schools
  - Cost of living adjustments shown automatically
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "A common frustration we all face is taking time going through the application process just to find out that a school doesn't meet our expectations. Hopefully this could help." (Salary thread creator - 193â†‘)
  2. "I saw the original post by the amazing u/content-cat2475 who outlined the frustration we must all feel going through the application process. To make it easier to look through the information I decided to make a version that allows us to submit information and for that information to be compiled live on a spreadsheet" (217â†‘ + 120ðŸ’¬)
  3. "If we can't afford the tuition at the school we work... Say I'm a teacher and a parent working for an international school. If I had to pay the tuition for my child, I wouldn't be able to afford it on my salary alone." (119â†‘ + 178ðŸ’¬) - Teachers want to understand real purchasing power

### 5. "Nightmare School" Warnings Come Too Late
- **Impact Score:** 9/10 - TRANSACTION BLOCKER
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (but impacts future transactions)
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS future transactions - Creates viral negative content about specific schools
- **Why This Score:** Teachers accept positions then discover schools are toxic/fraudulent. They post warnings on Reddit, but this information is scattered and unsearchable. If YouTeacher connected teachers to these schools, platform would be blamed. Schools continue recruiting new victims because warnings are buried in Reddit threads. Platform that fixes this builds massive trust.
- **Evidence Count:** 15+ dedicated "warning" or "avoid this school" posts about specific schools
- **Worst Case:** Teacher relocates to foreign country, discovers school has: unpaid salaries, toxic ownership, illegal working conditions, discrimination, contract fraud - stuck for full year
- **Typical Case:** Teacher endures 6-12 months at terrible school, posts Reddit warning after leaving, hopes to save others
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - CORE VALUE PROPOSITION:
  - Verified "Schools to Avoid" list (evidence-based)
  - Aggregate scattered Reddit warnings into searchable database
  - Require schools to respond to allegations (transparency)
  - Remove schools with verified complaints
  - Show warning indicators before teachers apply
  - "Community alerts" for schools under investigation
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "American International School Vietnam- Update and Warning for New Recruits... Here we are mid March and we still have not been paid in full for January, we have not received any of our February salary." (98â†‘ + 68ðŸ’¬)
  2. "Don't Fall for the Wuhan School Trap - International school teacher hereâ€”escaped from a deeply toxic situation and now watching the same school recycle the same propaganda playbook. This is a public service announcement for anyone considering a job at BASIS Wuhan China" (97â†‘ + 68ðŸ’¬)
  3. "Warning about Sedbergh Vietnam- BCIS! This is meant as a warning to all international teachers considering a career as an international teacher in Vietnam. Avoid this school like the plague." (55â†‘ + 96ðŸ’¬)
  4. "Worst School in Kuwait. NBS. Nottingham British School. Worked at Nottingham British School, in Jleeb. Genuinely the worst school I've taught at. The Egyptian owner has lied, stolen, intimidated and threatened staff on a regular basis. He shouldn't be near a school." (90â†‘ + 54ðŸ’¬)
  5. "A BA woman living in Kuwait at a terrible international school helllppppp... I was supposed to teach KG then I was told on the ground in front of my face that I was a SUB teacher... We didn't know! The HR department knew and didn't tell us" (44â†‘ + 96ðŸ’¬)

### 6. Credential Scams (Moreland/TeachNow "Fast-Track" Credentials)
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform (but impacts match quality)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Creates false credentialing that damages teacher careers long-term
- **Why This Score:** Teachers pay $6K for "credentials" that are not accepted by quality schools. They get matched to low-tier schools only, then get stuck. Platform that connects these teachers to jobs faces credibility issues. However, this is more about teacher qualification than platform failure directly. Can affect match quality and teacher expectations.
- **Evidence Count:** 1 major post (28â†‘ + 214ðŸ’¬ comments = massive debate)
- **Worst Case:** Teacher spends $6K on Moreland credential, works at low-tier ESL school in China for 2+ years, discovers credential not accepted for tier-1 international schools, wasted time and money
- **Typical Case:** Teachers debate whether Moreland is legitimate, confused about credential requirements
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - MODERATE IMPACT:
  - Clear credential requirement filters (only show schools teacher qualifies for)
  - Education about credential recognition by school tier
  - Warning labels: "This school accepts Moreland credentials" vs "Requires traditional teaching license"
  - Prevent teachers from wasting time applying to schools that won't accept their credentials
  - Transparent about school quality tiers
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Moreland/TeachNow is a scam. It has been a scam from Day One. It is the single biggest scam in international teaching." (28â†‘ + 214ðŸ’¬)
  2. "They don't want to take the time and money to do the real education programs. They want all the benefits of 'real' teaching jobs without doing almost any of the work to get qualified. That's the only reason."
  3. "'Why spend 2 years and $10-20K+ on tuition alone, when I could spend a few months and $6K instead, and get the same job, while still earning my full salary at crap ESL job at fake Chinese international school X!' How many times I've read that on here."

### 7. Ghosting After Interviews
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE (damages retention)
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (late stage)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Creates frustration but teachers keep trying
- **Why This Score:** Teachers invest time in full interview processes, then never hear back. This is unprofessional and frustrating but doesn't completely stop transactions - teachers apply elsewhere. However, it damages platform reputation if facilitated through job board. Community wants to "name and shame" schools that ghost, proving this is a pattern worth tracking.
- **Evidence Count:** 17 posts mentioning ghosting, dedicated post suggesting pinned list (75â†‘ + 74ðŸ’¬)
- **Worst Case:** Teacher completes 3-round interview, final stage, gets ghosted for weeks, loses other opportunities waiting, eventually gives up on that school
- **Typical Case:** Teacher has 1-2 interviews, no response for 2+ weeks despite follow-up emails, moves on frustrated
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - MODERATE DIFFERENTIATION:
  - Track school response rates and timing
  - Show "response time" metrics on school profiles
  - Require schools to close applications within X days
  - "Schools that respond promptly" filter/badge
  - Automated rejection emails if school doesn't respond
  - Teacher reviews can flag ghosting behavior
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Pinned post on schools which ghost after an interview - Wondering whether the subreddit would be open to a pinned post for naming and shaming schools which ghost candidates... it's entirely unprofessional, speaks volumes about the school itself" (75â†‘ + 74ðŸ’¬)
  2. "I've been seeing a lot of frustrated posts from teachers struggling to land interviews, getting ghosted after final rounds, or sending out hundreds of applications with zero results" (81â†‘ + 109ðŸ’¬)
  3. "Are any other black teachers in China having a hard time finding job?... I'm being rejected before the school even looks at the resume, I'm not looking to work at the best school in China but I'm looking to at least move up" (46â†‘ + 171ðŸ’¬)

### 8. Recruitment Agency Fee Traps (Teacher Horizons)
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (late stage)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Creates financial barriers and mistrust of intermediaries
- **Why This Score:** Teachers accept jobs through agency, discover red flags or health issues, try to back out, agency demands $1000 penalty despite no contract signed and 4.5 months notice. This creates fear of using recruitment platforms. If YouTeacher charged similar fees, this would be transaction killer. Proves market wants free/transparent matching, not fee-based gatekeepers.
- **Evidence Count:** 1 detailed post (61â†‘ + 71ðŸ’¬) but represents broader agency distrust
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts job through agency, backs out due to legitimate reasons (health issues, changed job terms), gets billed $1000 penalty, sours them on all job platforms
- **Typical Case:** Teachers wary of recruitment agencies due to fee structures and lack of transparency
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - MAJOR DIFFERENTIATOR:
  - NO TEACHER FEES - schools pay for listings/matches
  - Transparent pricing model (no hidden penalties)
  - Teachers can withdraw applications without penalty
  - Clear terms of service (no surprise fees)
  - Build trust by being explicitly anti-fee-trap
  - "No teacher fees ever" as core brand promise
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "I recently accepted a job through teacher horizons at a school. I never signed a contract, just accepted via email. After accepting the job, the job title changed, and a ton of red flags came up. This in combination with some health issues... Teacher Horizons is trying to bill me 1000 dollars which is absolutely insane given the situation." (61â†‘ + 71ðŸ’¬)
  2. "There are health issues that require access to good doctors which just arose, no contract signed, and terms of employment changed. Has anyone else faced this with teacher horizons and what did you do?"

### 9. Job Search Fatigue - "Hard Hiring Season" / Low Response Rates
- **Impact Score:** 6/10 - FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY
- **Funnel Stage:** Search (mid-funnel)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers eventually find jobs but process is exhausting
- **Why This Score:** Teachers report "hard hiring season," "sending out hundreds of applications," struggling to land interviews. This doesn't completely stop transactions but significantly slows matching velocity. Better platform UX and targeting could reduce this friction. Indicates poor signal-to-noise ratio in current job search methods.
- **Evidence Count:** 13 posts about job search difficulties, multiple references to "hard season"
- **Worst Case:** Teacher sends 200+ applications over 6 months, gets handful of interviews, accepts mediocre job out of desperation
- **Typical Case:** Teacher applies to 50-100 schools, gets 5-10 interviews, takes 3-6 months to find position
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - CORE PLATFORM VALUE:
  - Better matching algorithms (qualification filters reduce spray-and-pray)
  - Show teachers only schools they qualify for (save time)
  - School engagement indicators (which schools actively hiring)
  - Application tracking (stop duplicate/forgotten applications)
  - Interview scheduling automation
  - Higher signal-to-noise ratio than generic job boards
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Based on what some people have been posting it seems to be a hard hiring season. I feel for a lot of the teachers who are facing tough life decisions, many of us have been there and it's extremely stressful." (Kuwait warning post - 174â†‘ + 44ðŸ’¬)
  2. "I've been seeing a lot of frustrated posts from teachers struggling to land interviews, getting ghosted after final rounds, or sending out hundreds of applications with zero results" (81â†‘ + 109ðŸ’¬)
  3. "It Might Be a You Problem â€“ Why Job Hunting Prep Is Crucial for Teachers... Too many teachers treat job hunting like a side quest when it should be a full-blown strategy game" (81â†‘ + 109ðŸ’¬)

### 10. Visa & Legal Work Status Complexity
- **Impact Score:** 6/10 - FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-match / Post-match (depending on context)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers can complete matches but visa uncertainty creates abandonment
- **Why This Score:** Visa requirements are complex and intimidating, especially for first-time international teachers. Schools sometimes operate with illegal documentation or unclear legal status. This creates fear/uncertainty that slows applications. Not a complete transaction blocker (teachers eventually figure it out) but significant friction point.
- **Evidence Count:** 93 posts mentioning visa issues
- **Worst Case:** Teacher accepts job, arrives in country, discovers school cannot provide legal work visa, working illegally, faces deportation risk
- **Typical Case:** Teacher confused about visa requirements, delays application while researching, eventually proceeds with uncertainty
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - MODERATE VALUE:
  - Country-specific visa guides (simplified explanations)
  - School verification of visa sponsorship capability
  - "Visa support verified" badges
  - Checklist of documents needed before applying
  - Cannot solve government bureaucracy, but can provide clarity
  - Link to verified visa agents/consultants
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Unwritten Rules of Working at a 'Not-Quite-International' School in China... Leaving was a bureaucratic slog: checklists, signatures, surprise policy changes, veiled threats over release letters" (104â†‘ + 69ðŸ’¬)
  2. "Read this before accepting a job in Kuwait... There were a lot of challenges that I wasn't fully prepared for" (174â†‘ + 44ðŸ’¬)
  3. "A (positive) thread about how China has changed since COVID... Wound up in Japan for 2020-2023... moved back to China and am in a T1 in the West" - Visa/re-entry complexity (111â†‘ + 109ðŸ’¬)

---

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### 1. Community Self-Organizing Around Platform Failures
The existence of community-built solutions proves market gaps:
- **Salary transparency spreadsheet** (217â†‘ + 120ðŸ’¬): Teachers manually built Google Form + Sheet to crowdsource salary data because existing platforms don't provide this
- **Vetting checklist** (112â†‘ + 63ðŸ’¬): Teacher created comprehensive 26-point checklist because platforms don't help vet schools
- **"Name and shame" requests** (75â†‘ + 74ðŸ’¬): Community wants centralized place to report ghosting schools
- **School warning posts**: Individual teachers post "avoid this school" warnings that get buried in Reddit

**Business Implication:** These DIY solutions prove teachers WANT these features and will use them. YouTeacher doesn't need to invent new features - just formalize what the community already built informally.

### 2. International Schools â‰  ESL Schools (Two Different Markets)
r/internationalteachers is NOT the same market as r/TEFL. Key differences:
- **Credentials**: International schools require teaching licenses, TEFL schools accept TEFL certificates
- **School Quality**: International schools serve expat families, TEFL/bilingual schools serve local students
- **Salary**: International school salaries 2-4x higher than ESL/TEFL positions
- **Career Path**: International teaching is long-term career, TEFL is often gap year/temporary

**Business Implication:** YouTeacher needs to decide which market to serve. International school teachers have higher expectations for platform quality, vetting, and professionalism. They're also more willing to pay (indirectly through school listings) because stakes are higher.

### 3. "Tier System" is Real and Well-Understood
Teachers explicitly reference school tiers:
- **Tier 1**: Top international schools (IB, Western curriculum, expat students, competitive hiring)
- **Tier 2**: Mid-range international schools
- **Tier 3**: "Not-quite-international" bilingual schools (local students, lower requirements)

**Business Implication:** Platform should formalize tier system with transparent criteria. Teachers want to filter by tier, understand which tier they qualify for, and see realistic expectations for each tier.

### 4. Location Preferences Are Strong (But Underserved)
Teachers have strong location preferences but existing platforms don't help:
- "Least preferred locations" post (26â†‘ + 210ðŸ’¬) - massive discussion
- Kuwait repeatedly mentioned as "boring" / "culturally inaccessible" (174â†‘ + 44ðŸ’¬)
- China post-COVID changes (111â†‘ + 109ðŸ’¬) - teachers track country-level changes

**Business Implication:** Location-specific information (culture, lifestyle, expat community, etc.) is decision-critical but missing from job posts. YouTeacher could aggregate this information to help teachers make informed decisions.

### 5. Schools Treating Teachers as "Second-Class Citizens"
Beyond racial discrimination, multiple posts mention:
- Filipino teaching assistants excluded from class photos (Kuwait post)
- Teachers can't afford tuition at schools they work at (119â†‘ + 178ðŸ’¬)
- Owners' children treated as royalty, bully staff without consequence
- Fines for being 5 minutes late (100 RMB = $15 USD)

**Business Implication:** "Working conditions" and "management culture" reviews are critical vetting factors. Teachers want to know if they'll be respected, not just paid.

---

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### 1. Professional Development / Credential Requirements
**Pain Point:** Teachers confused about Moreland vs. traditional licenses, what credentials they need for tier-1 schools
**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher can provide information but cannot solve credentialing requirements (set by schools/governments)
**Mitigation:** Provide clear education guides, filter schools by credential acceptance, transparent about requirements

### 2. Cultural Adjustment / Lifestyle Fit
**Pain Point:** Kuwait is "boring," China culture shock, local language barriers
**Why Out of Scope:** These are personal adaptation issues, not job board problems
**Mitigation:** Provide location guides, expat community information, link to resources, but cannot fix cultural differences

### 3. Student Body Composition ("International" vs. Local Students)
**Pain Point:** Teachers want schools with >50% international students (50â†‘ + 112ðŸ’¬) but most schools now serve local populations
**Why Out of Scope:** Market trend toward local students, platform cannot change school demographics
**Mitigation:** Show student body composition transparently so teachers can filter preferences

### 4. Teaching Quality / Pedagogical Issues
**Pain Point:** Some posts discuss curriculum quality, professional development, teaching resources
**Why Out of Scope:** These are school operations issues, not hiring/matching problems
**Mitigation:** Include in school reviews but not primary platform focus

### 5. China-Specific Geopolitical Issues
**Pain Point:** Post-COVID changes, government policies, visa restrictions specific to China
**Why Out of Scope:** Government policy beyond platform control
**Mitigation:** Provide updated information, country-specific guides, but cannot solve policy issues

---

## Conclusion:

The r/internationalteachers community reveals that **existing job platforms are failing at basic trust and transparency**. Teachers are:
- Building their own salary databases (proof of platform failure)
- Posting manual school warnings (proof of vetting failure)
- Requesting centralized ghosting lists (proof of accountability failure)
- Applying to 100+ schools with no matches due to hidden discrimination (proof of targeting failure)

**YouTeacher's Opportunity:** Don't try to out-feature competitors. Fix the fundamental trust problems:
1. **Verify schools** (payment history, legal status, accreditation)
2. **Radical transparency** (salaries, reviews, red flags)
3. **Protect teachers** (flag discrimination, ban bad schools, no hidden fees)
4. **Aggregate community knowledge** (formalize Reddit warnings, vet checklists, salary data)

The community has already done the product development work by creating DIY solutions. YouTeacher just needs to make them official, searchable, and trustworthy.
