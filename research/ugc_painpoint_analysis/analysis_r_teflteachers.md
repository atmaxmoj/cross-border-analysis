  2. "[Comment] If they're hiring you as an English language instructor then they're all scams. More than likely they're hiring you illegally on a work permit that describes you as an administrative assistant or other nonsense. Sadly this is exploitive, all the risk and punishment falls onto you if caught."
  3. "I've heard so many horror stories of hagwons over working and forcing teachers to pull unpaid overtime. The places that I've interviewed at all seem to be pretty reputable but that being said I believe they just want to save face."

- **Funnel Stage:** Matching
- **Transaction Impact:** Stops
- **Evidence Count:** 135 posts (44.6% of all posts!)
- **Why This Score:** Transaction blocker. Users engage but the transaction never completes because this barrier prevents them from qualifying or being accepted. High engagement but zero revenue/matches.

  2. "My girlfriend and I are British Born Chinese and are thinking about doing a TEFL course to teach in China. We're a bit concerned that schools might be more favourable towards teachers who look more 'foreign.'"
  3. "Been reading posts throughout Reddit about teaching English in China and bit overwhelmed as its a completely different world out there and the qualification requirements/racial biases..."

3. "Can I apply for an English teaching job in China without having yet completed my Bachelor's degree?"

### 8. Can't Compare Salaries/Packages Effectively
- **Impact Score:** 7/10
- **Funnel Stage:** Search / Matching
- **Transaction Impact:** Slows
- **Evidence Count:** 20 posts
- **Why This Score:** Post-match failure or significant friction. Either causes early departure after matching or meaningfully slows down the matching process, reducing platform throughput.

**Representative Posts:**
1. "$2k in China or $3k in Hong Kong"
2. "HEELLPPP!! [Comparing two offers]"
3. "What is it like working in a public school in China?"

**Key Quotes:**
  1. "I kind of already have my mind set on hong kong, but I just got this china offer and kind of wanted to know what to think about it, so I can compare and contract better when the hong kong one comes. For example the 1st year china offer is only 9 months, I think they do that to not have to pay a bonus or pay for holidays?"
  2. "I am planning on moving abroad to China to teach, and I am super torn between two offers. Currently I have an offer for a 15 month contract in Dalian for 23,000 RMB/mo., 8 sick days paid at 50% and 5 unpaid annual leave days... The other offer is in Nanjing and offers 19,500 RMB after a 2 month probation period."
  3. "At first I thought the salary was two low, but they are giving me a 2000 yuan housing allowance among other stand things like health care and PTO." (Difficulty calculating total compensation)

  - Standardized salary disclosure format
  - Total compensation calculator (salary + housing + bonuses + flights)
  - Cost of living adjustment by city
  - Comparable salary range data by experience level

## Worst Case vs. Typical Case Analysis:

### Scam Listings & Recruiter Trust Issues
- **Worst Case:** Teacher loses thousands of dollars, gets deported, potentially arrested for illegal work visa ("recover stolen and lost funds from China/EF")
- **Typical Case:** Teacher spends weeks/months researching, "running in circles," unable to determine which opportunities are legitimate, eventually abandons job board entirely

### Discrimination
- **Worst Case:** Qualified teacher with UK passport gets rejected from 80% of schools purely due to appearance (PoC/Asian ethnicity), wastes months applying to impossible positions
- **Typical Case:** Teacher preemptively self-selects out of market entirely after reading Reddit threads about discrimination

### Document Apostille
- **Worst Case:** Teacher has to "cut europe trip short and go back to US" just for fingerprints, chooses different country (Hong Kong) due to complexity
- **Typical Case:** Teacher gets offer but abandons mid-process when they learn about apostille requirements and costs

### Contract Fraud
- **Worst Case:** "My EF Yingfu Teaching HELL Horror Story" - Lost wages, GoFundMe to recover stolen funds
- **Typical Case:** Suspicious contract terms (bonuses not in salary, 9-month contracts to avoid holiday pay), teacher declines offer

---

## New/Unexpected Findings:

### 1. Discrimination is THE Dominant Pain Point (135/303 posts - 44.6%)
Nearly half of all r/TEFLteachers posts mention discrimination concerns. This includes:
- Racial discrimination (PoC teachers facing rejections based on appearance)
- Native vs. non-native speaker discrimination
- Age discrimination
- Appearance-based discrimination ("foreign-looking" requirements)

**Business Impact:** This is a massive market segment being underserved. Non-native teachers and PoC teachers represent a huge potential user base that current platforms ignore.

### 2. "Fast Offer = Red Flag" Mental Model
Multiple posts mention being "weary" when schools offer jobs too quickly:
- "The china offer they gave me right after the 1st interview so kind of weary of what to expect"
- Teachers have learned that legitimate schools have multi-stage interviews

**Business Impact:** Platform needs to signal quality through process transparency, not just speed.

### 3. Information Scattered Across Platforms Creates Paralysis
Teachers mention "Reddit and TikTok" as primary research sources, showing:
- No single trusted information source exists
- UGC platforms dominate over job boards for research
- Teachers spend weeks researching before applying anywhere

**Business Impact:** Opportunity to become THE authoritative source for China ESL jobs.

### 4. Document Apostille Process is a Major Abandonment Point
Multiple mentions of having to "cut europe trip short" or "go back to US" just for fingerprints/apostille:
- Teachers don't understand the process until mid-application
- Unexpected costs and time requirements cause abandonment
- Some choose Hong Kong over China purely due to document complexity

**Business Impact:** Early education about requirements + document services could reduce abandonment.

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

### 1. Government Visa Policy Restrictions
**Problem:** Non-native speakers legally cannot teach English in China
**Evidence:** "You cannot legally teach English in China as a non-native. Rethink your plans."
**Why Out of Scope:** YouTeacher cannot change national visa policy
**Note:** Can still provide transparency about which schools hire illegally vs. legally

### 2. Cultural Adjustment & Social Isolation
**Problem:** Foreigners feeling disconnected, gatekeeping among expats
**Evidence:** Posts about "strange gatekeeping of foreigners" and loneliness
**Why Out of Scope:** Not a job board problem - this is post-arrival cultural adjustment
**Note:** Could provide community features, but not core to transaction success

### 3. General Teaching Quality/Performance Issues
**Problem:** "I got the job and moved to China - but I suck, now what?"
**Evidence:** Teachers realizing they're not good at teaching after arrival
**Why Out of Scope:** Job board facilitates match, not teaching training
**Note:** Could partner with TEFL training providers

### 4. Geopolitical Concerns & Government Restrictions
**Problem:** Concerns about "living under authoritarian government" and GFW
**Evidence:** "I'm a bit worried about living under an authoritarian government"
**Why Out of Scope:** Platform cannot solve political concerns
**Note:** Can provide transparent information about VPN usage, restrictions, etc.
