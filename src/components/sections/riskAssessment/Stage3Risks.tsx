      <p>
        <strong>Stage Goal:</strong> Premium tier uptake (Features B.6-B.9). Target: 30% schools upgrade. Revenue: $37K/month.
      </p>

      <h4>Risk 3.1: Schools Don't Upgrade to Premium Tier (Features B.6-B.9)</h4>
      <ProblemBox>
        <strong>Risk:</strong> Schools continue paying $49/post (Standard tier) but refuse to upgrade to $149/post Premium
        tier for verification badges, advanced features, and application tracking.<br/><br/>

        <strong>Impact (if occurs):</strong>
        <ul style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          <li>Revenue stuck at ~$15K/month (Stage 2 level) instead of $37K/month target</li>
          <li>Cannot build defensible moat (verification data doesn't scale)</li>
          <li>Vulnerable to Dave's ESL copying our features</li>
          <li>No path to Stage 4 excitement features (need Stage 3 revenue to fund development)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Probability: ðŸŸ¡ Medium (30%)</strong><br/>
        <strong>Evidence:</strong> Freemium conversion benchmarks are 2-5% typically. We target 30% (aggressive).
        Risk is schools may not value verification enough to pay 3x more ($149 vs $49).
      </ProblemBox>

      <SolutionBox>
        <strong>Mitigation Strategy:</strong><br/><br/>

        <strong>Validation BEFORE Building Premium Features:</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Month 12: Survey 100 schools posting on our platform
â”œâ”€â”€ Question: "Would you pay $149 (vs $49) to get verified badge + 3x more applications?"
â”œâ”€â”€ Show mockups of verification badge on listings
â”œâ”€â”€ Success criteria: 40%+ say "yes, I'd pay $149 for that"
â””â”€â”€ If <25% interest â†’ Don't build B.6-B.9, focus on volume growth instead`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Launch Strategy (Month 19):</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Offer free 30-day Premium trial to all Standard tier schools
â”œâ”€â”€ During trial, track metrics:
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Verified schools get 3x more applications (target: prove this empirically)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Application quality scores higher (teachers apply to verified schools first)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Time-to-hire reduces 20% (due to direct chat feature)
â”œâ”€â”€ End of trial: Send data report "Your listing got 47 applications (vs platform avg 16)"
â””â”€â”€ Conversion goal: 30% of trial users convert to Premium at end of 30 days`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Upsell Tactics:</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Competitive pressure: "78% of teachers only apply to verified schools" (show data)
â”œâ”€â”€ Scarcity: "Only 50 Premium verification slots available in Beijing market"
â”œâ”€â”€ Loss aversion: "Your competitor Shanghai High School just got verified - now ranking above you"
â”œâ”€â”€ ROI calculator: "$149/post Ã· 45 applications = $3.31 per applicant (cheapest recruitment channel)"
â””â”€â”€ Payment plans: "Pay $299/month for unlimited Premium posts (saves money at 2+ posts/month)"`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Alternative Revenue Path (If Premium Fails):</strong><br/>
        If &lt;15% upgrade rate by Month 24:
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Pivot to volume strategy: Keep price at $49, target 1,000+ schools posting
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1,000 schools Ã— $49 Ã— 2 posts/month = $98K/month (exceeds $37K target)
â”œâ”€â”€ Evidence: Dave's ESL has 500-700 schools posting monthly at $75
â”œâ”€â”€ Our advantage: $49 price + better UX = easier to reach 1,000 schools
â””â”€â”€ Trade-off: No premium moat, but volume creates network effects moat instead`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Kill Criteria:</strong>
        <ul style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          <li><strong>Month 24:</strong> If Premium tier uptake &lt;10% â†’ Abandon tiered pricing, focus on volume</li>
          <li><strong>Month 30:</strong> If total revenue &lt;$25K/month â†’ Cannot fund Stage 4 features, reassess whether to continue or exit</li>
        </ul>
      </SolutionBox>

      <h4>Risk 3.2: Verification System Liability Lawsuit (Feature B.6)</h4>
      <ProblemBox>
        <strong>Risk:</strong> A "verified" school commits fraud (non-payment, visa fraud, contract violation).
        Teacher sues YouTeacher for $100K+ damages, claiming verification badge was misleading.<br/><br/>

        <strong>Impact (if occurs):</strong>
        <ul style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          <li>Legal defense costs: $50K-$200K even if we win</li>
          <li>Settlement costs: $50K-$500K if we lose or settle to avoid trial</li>
          <li>Reputational damage: "YouTeacher verified a scam school" destroys trust</li>
          <li>Platform abandonment: Teachers stop using platform, revenue collapses</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Probability: ðŸŸ¢ Low (10%)</strong><br/>
        <strong>Evidence:</strong> Glassdoor, Yelp, TripAdvisor verify businesses and haven't faced systematic liability.
        Proper disclaimers + E&O insurance provide protection.
      </ProblemBox>

      <SolutionBox>
        <strong>Legal Protection (Implement Before Launch of B.6):</strong><br/><br/>

        <strong>1. Clear Disclaimers (Everywhere):</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ On verification badge: "Verified business license only. Not a guarantee of employment terms."
â”œâ”€â”€ Terms of Service: "Platform not liable for school behavior. Verification checks documents, not conduct."
â”œâ”€â”€ Teacher onboarding: Pop-up before first job application explaining verification scope
â””â”€â”€ Email footer: "Always review contracts independently. Verification â‰  endorsement."`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>2. Errors & Omissions Insurance:</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Coverage: $1M-$2M liability protection
â”œâ”€â”€ Cost: ~$1,200-$2,500/year (1-2% of Stage 3 revenue)
â”œâ”€â”€ Vendor: Hiscox, CNA, Chubb (standard E&O providers)
â””â”€â”€ Purchase before verifying first school`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>3. Verification Process Documentation:</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Public transparency page: "What verification includes/excludes"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Includes: Business license, registered address, contact verification
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Excludes: Employment contract terms, salary guarantees, working conditions
â”œâ”€â”€ Audit trail: Document every verification check (screenshots, dates, validator name)
â”œâ”€â”€ Revocation process: If fraud reported, remove badge within 24 hours
â””â”€â”€ Public changelog: "School X badge revoked on 2025-03-15 due to contract fraud reports"`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>4. Continuous Monitoring:</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Weekly scan: Check if verified schools have new fraud complaints (Reddit, forums)
â”œâ”€â”€ Quarterly re-verification: Confirm business license still valid
â”œâ”€â”€ Teacher feedback: "Report this school" button on every verified listing
â”œâ”€â”€ Threshold: 3+ fraud reports â†’ immediate investigation, temporary badge suspension
â””â”€â”€ Community moderation: Let teachers vote on badge revocation (transparency builds trust)`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Crisis Response Plan (If Lawsuit Occurs):</strong>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Immediate: Contact E&O insurance provider, engage lawyer
â”œâ”€â”€ Public statement: "We take this seriously. Badge revoked. Investigating verification process."
â”œâ”€â”€ Transparency: Publish incident report explaining what went wrong, how we'll prevent recurrence
â”œâ”€â”€ Compensation (optional): Offer affected teacher $500-$1,000 goodwill payment (no admission of guilt)
â””â”€â”€ System improvements: Update verification checklist to catch similar cases`}</div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Probability Reduction:</strong> With above safeguards, probability drops from 10% to &lt;5%. Cost: $3K-$5K/year (insurance + legal setup).
      </SolutionBox>

      <h4>Risk 3.3: Verification Data Quality Issues</h4>
      <ProblemBox>
        <strong>Risk:</strong> As we scale verification (target: 1,000+ schools by Month 36), quality degrades.
        Inconsistent verification standards, outdated business licenses, fake documents accepted.<br/><br/>

        <strong>Impact (if occurs):</strong>
        <ul style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          <li>Verification badge loses credibility with teachers</li>
          <li>Schools stop paying Premium tier ($149) if badge doesn't differentiate them</li>
          <li>Competitor attacks: "YouTeacher verification is a scam"</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Probability: ðŸŸ¡ Medium (25%)</strong>
      </ProblemBox>

      <SolutionBox>
        <strong>Mitigation:</strong><br/>
        <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Standardized checklist: Pete creates 15-point verification SOP document
â”œâ”€â”€ Verification dashboard: Track turnaround time, rejection rate, re-verification dates
â”œâ”€â”€ Quality audits: Monthly random sample of 20 verified schools â†’ re-check all documents
â”œâ”€â”€ Hire verification specialist at $50K/year when verify >500 schools/year
â”œâ”€â”€ Automation: Use AI to detect fake business licenses (OCR + government database cross-check)
â””â”€â”€ Community QA: Teachers can flag "This school doesn't match address on verification" â†’ triggers re-check`}</div>
