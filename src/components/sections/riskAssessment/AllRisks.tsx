      <Section id="top-risks" title="Top 5 Risks & Mitigation">
        <h4>1. Aggregation Sources Block Scraping</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Dave's Cafe or others detect scraping and block access.</p>

        <SolutionBox>
          <strong>Mitigation:</strong><br />
          <strong>Plan A:</strong> Respectful scraping (2-second delays, proper attribution)<br />
          <strong>Plan B:</strong> Negotiate official partnership/data feed<br />
          <strong>Plan C:</strong> Pivot to manual school submissions only<br />
          <strong>Plan D:</strong> Use RSS feeds where available<br /><br />

          <strong>Likelihood:</strong> Low (job boards generally allow aggregation)<br />
          <strong>Precedent:</strong> Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. aggregate successfully
        </SolutionBox>

        <h4>2. Insufficient School Adoption</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Schools don't see value in verification badges, won't pay.</p>

        <SolutionBox>
          <strong>Validation Strategy:</strong><br />
          <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Interview 20 schools before launch (already know pain points)
â”œâ”€â”€ Offer first 5 schools free premium for 6 months
â”œâ”€â”€ If <5 paying schools by Month 6 â†’ reassess pricing or value prop
â””â”€â”€ Hard pivot threshold: <10 schools by Month 9`}</div>
          <br />
          <strong>Alternative Monetization:</strong><br />
          â””â”€â”€ If B2B fails, pivot to teacher premium model (resume services, alerts)
        </SolutionBox>

        <h4>3. Verification System Liability</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Verified school turns out to be fraudulent, teachers blame platform.</p>

        <SolutionBox>
          <strong>Legal Protection:</strong><br />
          <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Clear disclaimer: "Verification is not a guarantee"
â”œâ”€â”€ Terms of service: Platform not liable for school behavior
â”œâ”€â”€ Insurance: E&O insurance ($1M coverage, ~$1,200/year)
â””â”€â”€ Transparent process: Show what verification includes/excludes`}</div>
          <br />
          <strong>Operational:</strong><br />
          <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Continuous monitoring of verified schools
â”œâ”€â”€ Quick response to complaints
â”œâ”€â”€ Revocation process for badges
â””â”€â”€ Public changelog of verification decisions`}</div>
        </SolutionBox>

        <h4>4. Founder Bandwidth & Burnout</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk:</strong> 2-person team stretched too thin, quality suffers or founders quit.</p>

        <SolutionBox>
          <strong>Scope Management:</strong><br />
          <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Ruthless feature prioritization
â”œâ”€â”€ No new features until core is proven
â”œâ”€â”€ Say no to 90% of ideas
â””â”€â”€ Hire help at $10K monthly revenue`}</div>
          <br />
          <strong>Sustainability:</strong><br />
          <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ No 80-hour weeks (unsustainable)
â”œâ”€â”€ Set boundaries (no weekend work after Month 6)
â”œâ”€â”€ Celebrate small wins
â””â”€â”€ Kill project quickly if not working (don't drag for years)`}</div>
          <br />
          <strong>Decision Tree:</strong><br />
          <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ If no PMF by Month 9 â†’ serious reassessment
â”œâ”€â”€ If both founders burned out â†’ pivot or shut down
â””â”€â”€ If one founder wants out â†’ offer buyout or dissolve`}</div>
        </SolutionBox>

        <h4>5. Payment Processing for Hong Kong Company</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Can't receive Alipay/WeChat payments from mainland users easily.</p>

        <SolutionBox>
          <strong>Multi-Pronged Approach:</strong><br />
          <div className="tree-structure">{`â”œâ”€â”€ Stripe (for international credit cards) - works immediately
â”œâ”€â”€ Ping++ (for aggregated Alipay/WeChat) - 1-2 week setup
â”œâ”€â”€ Alternative: Paymentwall, AsiaPay (other aggregators)
â””â”€â”€ Long-term: Establish WFOE if revenue > $100K/year`}</div>
          <br />
          <strong>Fallback:</strong><br />
          â””â”€â”€ Credit card only for first 3 months (acceptable for international schools)
