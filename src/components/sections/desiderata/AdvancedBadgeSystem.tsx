      <h4>C.8 Advanced School Badge System</h4>
      <InfoBox>
        <strong>Addresses:</strong> Question #6 (Scam prevention & platform discrimination) + Question #5 (Trust & verification)<br/>
        <strong>Solves Pain Point:</strong> Teachers report: "School had 4.5 stars but was terrible - fake reviews." "No way to know if school is LGBTQ+ friendly before applying." "Found out school had labor violations AFTER I signed contract." Teachers want multi-dimensional evaluation beyond basic star ratings.<br/>
        <strong>Evidence:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Glassdoor "Best Places to Work":</strong> Annual rankings based on employee reviews + company data created aspirational goal for companies. Contributed to $8.1B valuation. Companies actively compete to earn badges.</li>
          <li><strong>Yelp Health Scores:</strong> Integrated government health inspection data into restaurant listings. Differentiated Yelp from competitors, created trust through transparency. Restaurants improved hygiene to earn better scores.</li>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn "Top Companies":</strong> Multi-dimensional rankings (culture, growth, benefits) drive employer branding. Companies pay for recruitment tools to improve rankings.</li>
          <li><strong>Our context:</strong> ZERO ESL job boards have multi-dimensional school evaluation. Dave's ESL has no verification, SeriousTeachers has basic listings only.</li>
        </ul>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <strong>How Badges are Earned (Transparent Criteria):</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Public criteria:</strong> All badge requirements published (e.g., "High Retention = 80%+ contract completion")</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time tracking:</strong> Schools see dashboard showing progress toward each badge (e.g., "73% contract completion - 7% away from High Retention badge")</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic awards:</strong> Badges awarded automatically when criteria met (no manual review for Tier 1-2)</li>
          <li><strong>Audit required for Tier 3:</strong> Excellence badges require paid audit ($499/year) - prevents gaming, ensures quality</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Revenue Model:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Free:</strong> All earned badges displayed publicly on school profiles</li>
          <li><strong>"Badge Report" ($199):</strong> Detailed breakdown showing current scores, gap analysis, improvement recommendations</li>
          <li><strong>"Excellence Badge Audit" ($499/year):</strong> Manual audit for DEI Champion / Well-Managed / Career Growth badges, includes:
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', fontSize: '0.95em' }}>
              <li>On-site or video interview with management and teachers</li>
              <li>Contract review and policy documentation</li>
              <li>Certificate to display on school website</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>"Featured Badge Listings" ($99/month):</strong> Schools with 3+ badges get featured placement in search results</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This Creates a Moat:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Data infrastructure barrier:</strong> Requires government data scraping (Labor Bureau, Ministry of Education, courts), NLP/AI analysis, years of platform data. Competitors cannot replicate without massive investment.</li>
          <li><strong>Network effects:</strong> More teachers ‚Üí more reviews ‚Üí better badge accuracy ‚Üí schools compete for badges ‚Üí transparency improves ‚Üí attracts more teachers. Self-reinforcing cycle.</li>
          <li><strong>Behavior change:</strong> Schools actively improve DEI, management, retention to earn badges. Creates "game dynamics" - schools compete on quality metrics, not just price.</li>
          <li><strong>Proprietary scoring:</strong> Our algorithms (based on 50K+ reviews, contract completion data, payment history) cannot be reverse-engineered by competitors.</li>
          <li><strong>First-mover advantage:</strong> First platform to systematically evaluate ESL schools on multiple dimensions. Sets the standard, becomes reference point.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Success Metrics:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li>500+ schools earn at least one badge by Year 3</li>
          <li>100+ schools purchase Badge Report ($199) = $19,900/year revenue</li>
          <li>50+ schools purchase Excellence Badge Audit ($499/year) = $24,950/year revenue</li>
          <li>Teachers prefer applying to badged schools: 80%+ applications go to schools with 2+ badges</li>
          <li>Schools with badges get 5x more applications (creates incentive to earn badges)</li>
          <li>Measurable ecosystem improvement: Labor violation rate drops 30% among participating schools</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This is a Delighter (Not Performance Feature):</strong> Teachers DON'T expect multi-dimensional school evaluation - Dave's ESL has ZERO verification, SeriousTeachers has basic listings only. When teachers see badges showing DEI scores, government compliance data, and retention rates, they are DELIGHTED ("I can't believe they track this!"). Creates viral word-of-mouth and competitive moat competitors cannot easily copy.
