      <h4>Overview:</h4>
      <p>
        Glassdoor operates a two-sided marketplace connecting job seekers and employers. It provides free access to job seekers,
        offering anonymous company reviews, salary data, and interview experiences. Its primary revenue comes from premium
        services offered to employers.

      <h4>Key Learnings for YouTeacher:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Monetizing a Free User Base (Relevant to Question #3: Monetization):</strong> Glassdoor successfully monetizes employers (B2B) by
          providing immense value to job seekers (B2C) through its comprehensive user-generated content. This creates a powerful
          network effect: more user content attracts more job seekers, making the platform increasingly valuable for employers
          who then pay for access to this engaged talent pool.

          <InfoBox>
            <strong>Why User-Generated Content is Valuable for Employers:</strong>
            The direct link between employee-generated content and employer value is multi-faceted, addressing critical needs in talent acquisition and employer branding:

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Enhanced Employer Brand & Reputation Management:</strong> In today's competitive talent market, a strong employer brand is crucial. Job seekers actively research companies before applying (86% research company reviews before applying, per Glassdoor's own data). Positive reviews, transparent salary data, and insights into company culture directly contribute to a compelling employer brand. Employers pay to manage this narrative, respond to feedback, and showcase their best attributes to attract top talent.</li>
              <li><strong>Attracting Qualified Talent:</strong> By providing an "insider's view," Glassdoor helps job seekers self-select. Those who align with a company's culture and compensation expectations are more likely to apply, leading to a higher quality applicant pool for employers and reducing recruitment costs.</li>
              <li><strong>Competitive Intelligence:</strong> Employers gain invaluable insights into how they compare to competitors in terms of employee satisfaction, compensation, and benefits. This data helps them refine their talent strategies and remain competitive.</li>
              <li><strong>Increased Visibility & Access to Engaged Candidates:</strong> A platform rich with UGC attracts a large, active, and informed job seeker audience. Employers pay for direct access to this engaged pool through job postings, targeted advertising, and resume database access.</li>
            </ul>

          <strong>Building a Data Moat (Question #7):</strong> Glassdoor's core defensible moat is its unique, anonymous,
          user-generated content (reviews, salaries). This data is hard to replicate and becomes more valuable as it grows.
          <InfoBox>
            <strong>Glassdoor's Network Effect:</strong> More user content → more job seekers → more valuable for employers → more employers pay for services.

          <strong>Solving the Cold Start for UGC (Question #5):</strong> Glassdoor overcame the initial challenge of
          gathering content by:
          <ul>
            <li>**Pre-launch Content Gathering:** Amassed ~3,300 reviews for 250 companies before public beta.</li>
            <li>**Incentivized, Targeted Outreach:** Employed people to contact specific demographics (e.g., software engineers in Silicon Valley) with incentives (e.g., chance to win an iPod).</li>
            <li>**"Cold Mail" Campaigns:** Direct outreach to solicit reviews.</li>
            <li>**PR Launch:** Drove massive content influx (100,000 pieces in 48 hours) post-launch.</li>
          </ul>
