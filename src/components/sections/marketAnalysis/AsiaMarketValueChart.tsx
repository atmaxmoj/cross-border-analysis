          <li><strong>China still dominates with $2.45B market</strong> - 70,000 teachers (est. 40-100K range) at $35K/year avg. NOTE: Low data quality - no 2024 government statistics, market size based on 2017 baseline + post-2021 contraction estimates</li>
          <li><strong>S. Korea #2 at $645M</strong> - 13,443 verified E-2 visa holders (highest quality government data from Korea Immigration Service Dec 2024) at $48K avg</li>
          <li><strong>Japan #3 at $498M</strong> - 19,933 teachers (5,933 JET verified + 14K ALT/eikaiwa estimated) at $25K avg</li>
          <li><strong>Malaysia #4 at $428M</strong> - 9,500 teachers in 287 int'l schools (ISC Research: 111,185 students, July 2024) at $45K avg. NOTE: Previous estimate of "10,710 teachers" was incorrect - that was the STUDENT count</li>
          <li><strong>Total Asia market: ~$4.95B annually</strong> across 139,075 native English teachers in 11 countries (revised from $5.34B)</li>
          <li><strong>Vietnam revised down to $99M</strong> - Only 1,310 teachers verified in HCMC (Vietnam.vn 2024-25). Previous claim of "2,157 Hanoi+HCMC from Vietnam.vn & British Council" could NOT be verified</li>
          <li><strong>Data quality varies dramatically</strong> - S. Korea, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan have government-verified data. China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia rely on estimates and small Glassdoor samples</li>

        <strong>Primary Data Sources (All Verified):</strong> Government sources: Korea Immigration Service E-2 visa statistics Dec 2024, JET Programme USA Official 2025, Thai Ministry of Education 2021, Taiwan Ministry of Education TFETP, Hong Kong Education Bureau NET scheme 2024, State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs (SAFEA) China 2017. Glassdoor salary data: China PayScale (22 samples), Vietnam HCMC (328 samples), Vietnam Hanoi (118 samples), Thailand Bangkok (235 samples), Indonesia (411 samples), Malaysia (445 samples), Cambodia ISPP (20 samples). ISC Research: Malaysia 2024 (287 schools, 111,185 students), Indonesia 2024 (195 schools, 59,600 students), China 2025 (1,124 int'l schools). School employment pages: SCIS Shanghai, EPIK Korea, ESF Hong Kong, M'KIS Malaysia. International Schools Review (ISR) Forum: Malaysia salary discussions. Exchange rates: 2024 annual averages. All calculations show blended averages across language centers and international schools weighted by estimated market distribution. <strong>CRITICAL FINDING:</strong> Major consulting firms (Hays, Robert Walters, Michael Page) and Big 4 accounting firms (PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, EY) do NOT publish ESL teacher salary data for Asian markets - this sector is underserved by traditional business intelligence, validating market gap for systematic data aggregation.
