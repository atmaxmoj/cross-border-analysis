        <strong>Revenue:</strong> $0<br/>

        <strong>How We Gain Traffic:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Aggregate 10,000+ jobs = massive long-tail keyword coverage ("ESL jobs Beijing", "English teacher Shanghai", etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Better UX than Dave's ESL:</strong> Modern design, mobile-responsive, fast search = teachers prefer browsing on our site</li>
          <li><strong>Discord community:</strong> "Join our Discord - ask questions, verify schools, connect with teachers" â†’ Better than Dave's ghost town forum</li>
          <li><strong>Email alerts:</strong> "Get new ESL jobs in your inbox weekly" - capture email addresses for future marketing</li>
          <li><strong>Social proof:</strong> "Search 50,000 ESL jobs across 10 platforms in one place"</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Success Metrics:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li>10K+ monthly active teachers (website)</li>
          <li>500+ Discord members (active community)</li>
          <li>50K+ aggregated job listings</li>
          <li>5K+ email subscribers</li>
          <li>Avg time on site: 8+ minutes (vs Dave's ESL ~3 min)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Evidence:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Indeed (2004-2007):</strong> Pure aggregator for 3 years, built massive traffic before monetizing. By 2007, had 25M+ monthly visitors from aggregated job listings.</li>
          <li><strong>Airbnb (2009):</strong> Scraped Craigslist to solve cold start problem, drove initial traffic before hosts posted directly.</li>
          <li><strong>Discord for communities:</strong> 500M+ users, modern mobile-first experience. Crypto projects, gaming communities, SaaS products use Discord as community hub before building custom forums. Zero dev time, instant moderation tools, real-time chat vs Dave's ESL async forum.</li>
          <li><strong>Our context:</strong> Dave's ESL has terrible UX (1995-era design) + "ghost town" forum. Teachers already searching for jobs - we just make it easier + provide active Discord community.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why $0 Revenue is Correct:</strong> Need teacher traffic FIRST before schools will pay to post directly. Aggregation is the trojan horse to build audience without needing supply-side (schools) to engage yet.

        <strong>Why Discord in Stage 1:</strong> Building custom forum = 4-8 weeks Mojo dev time + ongoing maintenance + moderation tools. Discord = free, zero dev time, better UX than Dave's ESL forum. Trade-off: Users leave website (acceptable friction in Stage 1). Stage 2: Integrate Discord into site via iframe/widget.
