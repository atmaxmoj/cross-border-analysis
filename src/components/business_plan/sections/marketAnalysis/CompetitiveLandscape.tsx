          <strong>Two-Tier Market:</strong> Cross-border hiring in China splits between (1) high-end: international recruitment agencies (Hays, Michael Page, Robert Half) serving executives/professionals with white-glove service, and (2) mid-market: job boards (HiredChina, LinkedIn) where candidates self-serve. Teaching sits in mid-market tier.
        </p>
        <p style={{ margin: '5px 0', fontSize: '0.85em', lineHeight: '1.8', color: '#78350f' }}>
          <strong>YouTeacher's Potential Edge:</strong> None of these platforms solve the <strong>scam verification problem</strong> that plagues teaching (and increasingly other sectors - fake tech jobs, sketchy hostess bar "marketing" roles). If expanding beyond teaching, focus on <strong>employer verification and candidate protection</strong> - differentiate on trust, not just job volume. Position as "the platform that vets employers so you don't get scammed" rather than competing on recruiter relationships like agencies.

      <h4 style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}>Expansion Scenario 2: All Cross-Border Jobs in Asia</h4>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#718096', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
        If YouTeacher expands to serve <strong>foreigners seeking jobs across all Asian countries</strong> (not just China), we would compete with cross-border platforms and international recruitment agencies that help workers relocate across Asia. Each country has different visa requirements, work cultures, and hiring practices - making pan-Asia cross-border hiring complex.

          <strong>Fragmented by Sector & Country:</strong> Cross-border hiring in Asia splits by (1) <strong>high-end professional</strong>: international recruitment agencies (Hays, Michael Page, Robert Half) serving executives/managers, (2) <strong>international school teaching</strong>: specialized recruiters (ISS, Search Associates, TIE) serving K-12 teachers, and (3) <strong>mid-market general</strong>: job boards (LinkedIn, GaijinPot) where candidates self-serve. Each sector has different visa requirements and hiring practices per country.
        </p>
        <p style={{ margin: '5px 0', fontSize: '0.85em', lineHeight: '1.8', color: '#78350f' }}>
          <strong>LinkedIn's Dominance vs. Niche Specialists:</strong> LinkedIn is the only true pan-Asia platform for cross-border hiring, but it lacks sector-specific expertise. GaijinPot dominates Japan foreign workers; ISS/Search dominate int'l school teaching. Each niche specialist wins by solving country-specific or sector-specific problems LinkedIn doesn't address.
        </p>
        <p style={{ margin: '5px 0', fontSize: '0.85em', lineHeight: '1.8', color: '#78350f' }}>
          <strong>YouTeacher's Path:</strong> Expanding beyond China teaching to "all Asia cross-border jobs" requires competing with entrenched players in each country (GaijinPot in Japan, Hays/Michael Page in Singapore/HK). <strong>Recommendation: Vertical expansion (China teaching ‚Üí all China jobs) is easier than horizontal expansion (China ‚Üí Japan/Korea/SEA)</strong> because each new country requires different visa expertise, language support, employer relationships, and cultural knowledge. Master one country deeply before going regional.
