      <h4 style={{ marginTop: '30px' }}>SWOT Analysis of Wirecutter:</h4>
      <div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', gap: '15px', marginTop: '15px' }}>
        <div style={{ padding: '15px', backgroundColor: '#f0fff4', border: '2px solid #68d391', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
          <strong style={{ color: '#2f855a' }}>Strengths</strong>
          <ul style={{ margin: '5px 0', fontSize: '0.85em', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            <li>Trust-based moat - rigorous testing methodology (100+ products narrowed to 1-3 recommendations) creates defensible competitive advantage</li>
            <li>Editorial independence - transparent disclosure of affiliate model maintains credibility vs shill review sites</li>
            <li>Expert-driven content - dedicated staff test products hands-on (not just desk research), validates recommendations</li>
            <li>NYT acquisition validation - $30M purchase by New York Times (2016) confirmed value of trust-based content model</li>
            <li>Affiliate monetization - generates revenue without paywalling content, readers convert at high rates due to trust</li>
            <li>SEO dominance - "best [product category]" queries rank #1 on Google, drives massive organic traffic</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div style={{ padding: '15px', backgroundColor: '#fff5f5', border: '2px solid #fc8181', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
          <strong style={{ color: '#c53030' }}>Weaknesses</strong>
          <ul style={{ margin: '5px 0', fontSize: '0.85em', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            <li>Testing costs don't scale - buying 100+ products per category (vacuum cleaners, mattresses) requires massive upfront capital</li>
            <li>Limited category coverage - can't test everything (software, services, B2B products), restricted to physical consumer goods</li>
            <li>Affiliate dependency - 100% revenue from Amazon/retail affiliates, vulnerable if partners cut commission rates (Amazon did 2020)</li>
            <li>Update burden - products change frequently, requires constant re-testing to maintain accuracy (editorial treadmill)</li>
            <li>No network effects - each review stands alone, doesn't benefit from user contributions like Glassdoor/Stack Overflow</li>
            <li>Brand concentration risk - heavily associated with NYT, limits independent brand building and monetization flexibility</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div style={{ padding: '15px', backgroundColor: '#ebf8ff', border: '2px solid #4299e1', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
          <strong style={{ color: '#2c5282' }}>Opportunities</strong>
          <ul style={{ margin: '5px 0', fontSize: '0.85em', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            <li>International expansion - replicate model in EU, Asia with local products (currently US-focused)</li>
            <li>B2B product testing - enterprise software, SaaS tools underserved by rigorous independent review</li>
            <li>Video content - YouTube/TikTok testing videos capture younger audiences, higher engagement than text</li>
            <li>Subscription model - premium tier for early access, extended guides, personalized recommendations (diversify from affiliates)</li>
            <li>Direct commerce - Wirecutter-branded products leveraging trust (like NYT Cooking recipes), higher margins than affiliate fees</li>
            <li>Community contributions - add user reviews, long-term ownership reports to augment expert testing</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div style={{ padding: '15px', backgroundColor: '#fef5e7', border: '2px solid #ecc94b', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
          <strong style={{ color: '#744210' }}>Threats</strong>
          <ul style={{ margin: '5px 0', fontSize: '0.85em', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            <li>Amazon affiliate cuts - 2020 commission rate reduction slashed revenue 30-50%, threatens business model viability</li>
            <li>AI-generated reviews - ChatGPT/LLMs synthesizing reviews at scale, flood Google with low-cost competitor content</li>
            <li>TikTok/YouTube reviewers - influencers with direct brand deals undercut affiliate model, capture younger demographics</li>
            <li>Manufacturer backlash - negative reviews damage brands, risk of lawsuits or review manipulation pressure</li>
            <li>Google algorithm changes - SEO ranking volatility threatens organic traffic (primary distribution channel)</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports competition - established player with deeper testing resources, non-profit credibility advantage</li>
          </ul>
