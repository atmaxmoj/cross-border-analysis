      <h4>Key Learnings for YouTeacher:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The "Ghost Town" Effect on Dave's ESL Cafe (Question #1):</strong> The incumbent's forums show urgent
          questions receiving zero replies, indicating a decay in community engagement despite high traffic. This highlights
          an opportunity for a new platform to build a more responsive and valuable community.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Peizheng College Incident (Question #5):</strong> This detailed example of contract fraud, hidden fees,
          and undisclosed health risks (nanovirus outbreak) underscores the extreme severity of teacher pain points. It
          provides a concrete scenario that our verification and trust-building features must prevent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Community-Built Salary Spreadsheet (Question #7):</strong> The fact that teachers on r/internationalteachers
          created their own DIY Google Sheet for salary comparison demonstrates a clear, unmet user need for structured,
          transparent data. This highlights an opportunity to build a data moat around valuable, user-contributed information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The "100 Rejections" Story (Question #6):</strong> The case of a qualified teacher being rejected from 100+
          schools due to race provides a powerful human narrative for the problem of discrimination, emphasizing the need
          for a clear platform stance.
