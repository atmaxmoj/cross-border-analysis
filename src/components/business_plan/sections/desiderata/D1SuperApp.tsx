      <h4>D.1 ESL Teacher Super-App (WeChat for Teachers)</h4>
      <InfoBox>
        <strong>Transformation:</strong> Platform → Ecosystem. Become the ONE app teachers need for their ENTIRE life abroad, not just job search.<br/><br/>

        <strong>Features Beyond Jobs:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Housing marketplace:</strong> Find apartments near school, roommate matching, landlord reviews (like Airbnb + Zillow combined)</li>
          <li><strong>Banking & remittances:</strong> Partner with Wise/Revolut for teacher-optimized accounts, send money home at low fees, currency exchange</li>
          <li><strong>Visa services:</strong> Partner with visa agencies, automate work permit renewals, document checklists, status tracking</li>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Insurance marketplace for expats, clinic directory, telemedicine in English, prescription translation</li>
          <li><strong>Social:</strong> Weekly meetups (C.6), dating (Bumble BFF for expat teachers), events, city guides</li>
          <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Chinese/Korean/Japanese language classes, cultural training, local survival tips</li>
          <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Contract translation, labor law Q&A, lawyer directory</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This is Disruptive:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Winner-take-all dynamics:</strong> Once teachers have housing, banking, healthcare, visa on one app, switching cost becomes MASSIVE. Network effects across all services.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform → Ecosystem:</strong> Not just matching supply/demand, but enabling teacher's entire life abroad. Creates dependency.</li>
          <li><strong>10x value increase:</strong> From "$49/job post" business to "take 1% of teacher's rent, 0.5% of remittances, 5% of insurance" business.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Evidence:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>WeChat:</strong> Started as messaging (2011), became super-app with payments, shopping, banking, government services, healthcare. 1.3B users, $20B+ revenue. Users spend 82 min/day because EVERYTHING is on WeChat.</li>
          <li><strong>Grab (Southeast Asia):</strong> Started as ride-hailing (2012), now does food delivery, payments (GrabPay), insurance, loans, investments. $40B valuation. "Super-app" strategy dominates in Asia where mobile-first users prefer one app for everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Gojek (Indonesia):</strong> Started as ride-hailing, expanded to 20+ services. $10B+ valuation. Proof: Super-apps work in emerging markets with fragmented service providers.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Revenue Projection (Year 5):</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li>Job postings: $444K/year (base business)</li>
          <li>Housing commissions: 1 month rent × 5,000 teachers/yr × $500 avg = <strong>$2.5M/year</strong></li>
          <li>Banking referrals: $50/teacher × 10,000 active users = <strong>$500K/year</strong></li>
          <li>Insurance commissions: $100/teacher × 5,000 policies = <strong>$500K/year</strong></li>
          <li>Visa service fees: $200/renewal × 8,000 renewals/yr = <strong>$1.6M/year</strong></li>
          <li>Payment processing: 0.5% of $50M remittances = <strong>$250K/year</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Total: $5.8M/year (13x base business)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This is D-Tier (Not C-Tier):</strong> Fundamentally changes business model from "job board" to "life operating system for expat teachers." Creates switching costs so high that competitors can't poach users. WeChat evidence: Once users have payments, banking, government services on platform, they CANNOT leave even if better messaging apps exist.
