      <h4>D.2 School Management SaaS (Workday for ESL Schools)</h4>
      <InfoBox>
        <strong>Transformation:</strong> Instead of schools posting jobs on our marketplace, we become their ENTIRE HR/payroll/compliance software. Flip the business model from transactional to recurring revenue.<br/><br/>

        <strong>Features:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Applicant Tracking System (ATS):</strong> Manage applications, schedule interviews, rate candidates, send offers, track pipeline metrics</li>
          <li><strong>Onboarding automation:</strong> Visa paperwork generation, work permit applications, contract templates, background checks, document storage</li>
          <li><strong>Payroll & benefits:</strong> Automate monthly salary payments, tax withholding, housing allowances, flight reimbursements, bonus calculations</li>
          <li><strong>Performance management:</strong> Teacher evaluations, 360-degree feedback, goal setting, promotion tracking</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance & legal:</strong> Track work permits, visa renewals, contract expirations, labor law compliance (China, Korea, Japan), automatic alerts</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics & reporting:</strong> Hiring pipeline metrics (time-to-hire, cost-per-hire), retention analysis, turnover prediction, salary benchmarking</li>
          <li><strong>Teacher self-service portal:</strong> Teachers view contracts, payslips, request time off, update documents</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This is Disruptive:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Recurring revenue:</strong> From $49/job post (one-time) to $199-$499/month (recurring). 10x lifetime value increase.</li>
          <li><strong>Lock-in effect:</strong> Once school's entire HR system, payroll, compliance data is on our platform, switching cost = 6-12 months migration + risk of compliance errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Data moat:</strong> Access to all teacher performance data, retention patterns, salary structures = proprietary insights competitors don't have.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Evidence:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Workday:</strong> $70B market cap selling HR/payroll/finance software to enterprises. Avg customer pays $500K-$2M/year. Enterprise SaaS = massive, predictable revenue.</li>
          <li><strong>BambooHR:</strong> $4B valuation (private) selling to SMBs. $99-$299/month per company. Proof: SMB HR SaaS is viable, profitable market.</li>
          <li><strong>Our context:</strong> ESL schools have ZERO specialized HR software. They use Excel spreadsheets for payroll, manual visa tracking, paper contracts. Pain is REAL, willingness to pay is HIGH.</li>
          <li><strong>ADP (payroll SaaS):</strong> $100B+ market cap. Proof: Payroll alone is massive recurring revenue business, we add compliance + ATS on top.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Pricing Tiers:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Starter ($199/month):</strong> 1-50 teachers. ATS + basic payroll + compliance alerts</li>
          <li><strong>Professional ($399/month):</strong> 50-200 teachers. Add performance management, advanced analytics, API integrations</li>
          <li><strong>Enterprise ($799/month):</strong> 200+ teachers. Multi-campus management, custom workflows, dedicated support</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Revenue Projection (Year 5):</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li>Target: 1,000 schools on SaaS platform</li>
          <li>Mix: 60% Starter ($199), 30% Professional ($399), 10% Enterprise ($799)</li>
          <li>Calculation: (600 × $199) + (300 × $399) + (100 × $799) = $119,400 + $119,700 + $79,900 = <strong>$319K/month</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $3.8M/year</strong></li>
          <li>Churn rate: 10%/year (low because switching cost is high)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why Schools Will Pay:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Current cost:</strong> HR manager salary ($30K/yr) + visa agency fees ($500/teacher × 20 teachers = $10K/yr) + compliance fines (variable, $5K-$50K if caught) = $45K+/year</li>
          <li><strong>Our cost:</strong> $199-$799/month = $2.4K-$9.6K/year</li>
          <li><strong>ROI:</strong> 5x-20x cheaper + eliminates compliance risk + better hiring outcomes = no-brainer for schools with 50+ teachers</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This is D-Tier (Not C-Tier):</strong> Fundamentally changes market structure. From "job board marketplace" (two-sided, transactional) to "B2B SaaS platform" (one-sided, recurring). Schools become DEPENDENT on our software for core operations (payroll, compliance). Cannot switch without massive disruption. This is Workday/BambooHR-level transformation.
