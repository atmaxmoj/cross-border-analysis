      <h4>D.4 Teacher Collectives & Collective Bargaining (Platform Cooperatives)</h4>
      <InfoBox>
        <strong>Transformation:</strong> Teachers form "guilds" or "teaching collectives" to negotiate as groups. Shift power dynamics from "schools have all leverage" to "teachers negotiate collectively." Platform facilitates coordination previously impossible.<br/><br/>

        <strong>Features:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Collective formation:</strong> Teachers form groups (e.g., "Beijing English Department Collective" = 20 teachers)</li>
          <li><strong>Collective bargaining:</strong> Group negotiates with schools for:
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', fontSize: '0.95em' }}>
              <li>Higher base salary (collective asks for 22K RMB vs individual asks for 18K)</li>
              <li>Better benefits (housing allowance, flight reimbursement, health insurance)</li>
              <li>Improved working conditions (max class size, teaching hours cap, PTO guarantees)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Team placements:</strong> Schools hire ENTIRE teams instead of individuals
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', fontSize: '0.95em' }}>
              <li>"We need an English department of 10 teachers for August" → collective provides pre-formed team</li>
              <li>Reduces school hiring costs (one negotiation vs 10)</li>
              <li>Reduces teacher risk (arrive with support network, not alone)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Pooled benefits:</strong> Collective negotiates group rates for:
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', fontSize: '0.95em' }}>
              <li>Health insurance (500 teachers = better rates than individual)</li>
              <li>Retirement/pension funds</li>
              <li>Professional development (TEFL courses, language classes)</li>
              <li>Legal protection (lawyer retainer for contract disputes)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Teachers vote democratically on:
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', fontSize: '0.95em' }}>
              <li>Which schools to work with (blacklist schools with labor violations)</li>
              <li>Minimum acceptable salary/conditions</li>
              <li>Collective leadership (elected representatives negotiate with schools)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Reputation system:</strong> Collectives build brand ("XYZ Collective = high-quality teachers, reliable, professional")</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This is Disruptive:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Power shift:</strong> ESL teaching is fragmented, individualistic. Teachers compete AGAINST each other ("I'll accept 16K RMB if you won't hire me at 18K"). Collectives flip this - teachers negotiate AS A BLOCK.</li>
          <li><strong>Market structure change:</strong> From "gig economy race to bottom" to "organized labor with negotiating power"</li>
          <li><strong>Impossible without platform:</strong> Coordination problem previously unsolvable (teachers dispersed globally, don't know each other). Platform enables collective action at scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Evidence:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Labor unions:</strong> Multi-billion dollar industry (UAW, Teamsters, teachers' unions). Proof: Collective bargaining works, workers pay dues for representation.</li>
          <li><strong>Stocksy (photographer cooperative):</strong> Photographers own platform collectively, negotiate rates with clients. $10M+ annual revenue, 1,000+ member-owners. Proof: Creative cooperatives viable in digital age.</li>
          <li><strong>Driver's Cooperative (NYC):</strong> Ride-hailing co-op owned by drivers. Launched 2020, competes with Uber/Lyft. Drivers keep 90% of fare vs 60-70% on Uber. Proof: Platform cooperatives can challenge incumbents.</li>
          <li><strong>Freelancers Union:</strong> 500K+ members, negotiates group health insurance, fights for freelancer rights. $10M+ annual revenue. Proof: Even gig workers will organize if platform facilitates coordination.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Revenue Model:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Platform fee:</strong> 5% of collective contract value (vs 10-15% traditional recruiter fee)
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', fontSize: '0.95em' }}>
              <li>Example: 10 teachers × $30K salary × 5% = $15K fee per collective placement</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Membership dues:</strong> $10/month per teacher in collective (optional, for premium benefits like legal protection)
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', fontSize: '0.95em' }}>
              <li>500 teachers × $10/month = $5K/month = $60K/year</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Insurance commissions:</strong> Earn 10-15% commission on group health/insurance policies</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Revenue Projection (Year 5):</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li>50 collective placements/year × $15K avg fee = <strong>$750K/year</strong></li>
          <li>2,000 teachers paying membership dues = <strong>$240K/year</strong></li>
          <li>Insurance commissions: <strong>$100K/year</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Total: $1.1M/year</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why Schools Will Accept This:</strong>
        <ul style={{ margin: '10px 0', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
          <li><strong>Lower hiring costs:</strong> One negotiation for 10 teachers vs 10 separate negotiations (saves time)</li>
          <li><strong>Higher quality:</strong> Collectives self-select best teachers (reputation at stake), filter out poor performers</li>
          <li><strong>Lower turnover:</strong> Teachers in collectives have support network → stay longer → reduces replacement costs</li>
          <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Collective guarantees replacements if teacher leaves mid-contract (insurance for school)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Why This is D-Tier (Not C-Tier):</strong> Fundamentally changes industry POWER DYNAMICS, not just user experience. Labor unions = $billions industry, but stagnant/declining. Platform cooperatives = modern version of unions, enabled by technology. This shifts from "marketplace extracting rent" to "platform facilitating teacher ownership." Controversial, radical, but transforms market structure if successful.
