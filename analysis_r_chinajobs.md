## Pain Points Found (Ranked by Impact Score):

### 1. Scam Listings & Fraudulent Recruiters
- **Impact Score:** 10/10 - PLATFORM KILLER
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform (destroys trust in entire job board category)
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Teachers won't use job boards after being scammed
- **Why This Score:** Scams destroy platform trust permanently. Teachers who get scammed tell others to avoid ALL job boards, not just the scammer. This creates platform-wide reputation damage.
- **Evidence Count:** 44 posts with scam-related complaints
- **Worst Case:** Identity theft, payment demanded upfront, deportation, harassment
- **Typical Case:** Fake job listings, demands for money, credential theft, blacklisting threats
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Verification system, school vetting, no fake listings

### 2. Visa/Legal Compliance Issues
- **Impact Score:** 9/10 - TRANSACTION BLOCKER
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (blocks job acceptance) & Post-match (deportation risk)
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS - Teachers won't accept jobs without proper Z visa
- **Why This Score:** Working illegally = deportation = platform liability. Schools offering tourist visa work destroy trust. Teachers research visa legitimacy before accepting offers.
- **Evidence Count:** 206 posts mentioning visa/work permit issues
- **Worst Case:** Deportation, fines, blacklisting from re-entry, arrest
- **Typical Case:** Schools offering tourist visa work, delayed Z visa processing, 'we'll sort it later'
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Only list schools that provide proper Z visas, verification system
- **Key Quotes:**

### 3. Contract Violations & Payment Issues
- **Impact Score:** 9/10 - TRANSACTION BLOCKER / POST-MATCH FAILURE
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (damages platform reputation)
- **Transaction Impact:** STOPS future transactions - Platform gets blamed for bad matches
- **Why This Score:** Teachers who get unpaid or contract-scammed blame the discovery platform. 'I found this job on [platform] and got screwed' = platform reputation damage. Future teachers avoid platforms with these stories.
- **Evidence Count:** 135 posts about contract/payment issues
- **Worst Case:** Unpaid wages, contract switched on arrival, impossible working hours, trapped in bad job
- **Typical Case:** Contract changes after signing, unpaid overtime, salary withheld, excessive hours
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Pre-vet schools, contract templates, review system. Can't control post-match behavior 100% but can filter bad actors.
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Could use an opinion (Or several) reviewing an English teaching contract" - Using a throwaway just to be on the safe side.

### 4. Information Asymmetry / Lack of Guidance
- **Impact Score:** 8/10 - MID-FUNNEL CHURN
- **Funnel Stage:** Pre-platform & Search (confusion prevents engagement)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers give up before finding jobs
- **Why This Score:** Overwhelmed teachers abandon search. 'Too confusing, too risky, I'll just stay home.' Every confused teacher is a lost conversion. Complexity = abandonment.
- **Evidence Count:** 153 posts asking basic questions about process/requirements
- **Worst Case:** Teacher gives up entirely on China due to information overload
- **Typical Case:** 'How do I...?' 'Where can I find...?' 'Is this legitimate?' 'Need advice'

- **Key Quotes:**

### 5. Recruiter/Agency Trust Issues
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE
- **Funnel Stage:** Matching (intermediary friction) & Post-match (salary skimming)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Teachers avoid platforms with recruiters
- **Why This Score:** Teachers actively try to AVOID recruiters. 'Direct hire only' is a common demand. Platforms seen as recruiter-heavy get abandoned. But doesn't fully stop transactions like scams do.
- **Evidence Count:** Multiple posts asking 'how to avoid recruiters'
- **Worst Case:** Recruiter takes salary cut without teacher knowing, false promises
- **Typical Case:** 'How do I find direct school contact?' 'Avoid recruiters' 'Recruiter taking my pay'
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - Direct school connections, no middle-men, transparent listings
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "Best site to find a job directly with a school, avoiding recruiters? "
  2. "How can I make sure I am avoiding recruiters that might take a percentage of my pay?"
  3. "Avoid the pollution, traffic and high prices. Experience the real China and save money in a Tier 2 or Tier 3 city. Free apartment, Chinese lessons, 3 days off per week."

### 6. Poor Working Conditions / School Quality
- **Impact Score:** 7/10 - POST-MATCH FAILURE
- **Funnel Stage:** Post-match (teacher quits, negative reviews)
- **Transaction Impact:** Platform reputation damage - 'I got this job through [platform]'
- **Why This Score:** Teachers quit bad jobs early, leave negative reviews, warn others. Platform gets associated with bad schools if not curated. BUT teachers still complete initial transaction.
- **Evidence Count:** 38 posts about terrible schools/experiences
- **Worst Case:** Teacher quits within weeks, traumatic experience, warns others publicly
- **Typical Case:** Overwork, no training, bad management, 'nightmare' school
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** YES - School reviews, quality vetting, blacklist bad schools
- **Key Quotes:**

  2. "My Terrible Experience in Datong with Andy's School"

---

### 7. Discrimination (Age, Appearance, Nationality)
- **Impact Score:** 6/10 - FRICTION THAT REDUCES VELOCITY
- **Funnel Stage:** Search (reduces match rate)
- **Transaction Impact:** SLOWS - Some teachers excluded, but others still match
- **Why This Score:** Frustrating but doesn't break the platform. Teachers over 60 or non-native speakers get filtered out, reducing total addressable market, but platform still works for qualified teachers.
- **Evidence Count:** 57 posts mentioning discrimination/age limits/native speaker requirements
- **Worst Case:** Qualified teacher can't find any jobs due to age/nationality
- **Typical Case:** Age limits (under 60), native speaker only, appearance requirements
- **Can YouTeacher Solve?** PARTIALLY - Can flag schools with flexible requirements, but can't force schools to change hiring criteria
- **Key Quotes:**
  1. "WARNING: Golden Staffing Recruitment Scam - Demands Payment Then Harasses Those Who Expose Them"
  2. "**Public service announcement!**[For Hire. High paying job in Shenzhen. Yaohua Experimental School ."
  3. "[HIRING] Global Game Operation Management"
  4. "Review of Shane English and CTP in Shanghai"
  5. "All genuine China internships are free - those asking you to pay a fee are genuine scams"

================================================================================

## New/Unexpected Findings:

1. **Active blacklist communities:** Teachers maintain extensive blacklists of bad schools/recruiters across multiple forums (CFTU, ESLWatch, Scam.com). This shows:
   - High distrust in existing platforms
   - Strong demand for verified/safe listings
   - Community self-policing due to platform failure

2. **'Over 90% of jobs are fake':** One veteran teacher claimed 90%+ of ESL Cafe/eChinaCities listings are resume-harvesting scams. This is HUGE - it means existing platforms are mostly fraudulent.

3. **Identity theft concern:** Multiple warnings about fake recruiters collecting passports/credentials for identity theft. Teachers are paranoid about sending documents.

4. **'Direct hire only' demand:** Consistent pattern of teachers actively trying to avoid ALL recruiters/agencies. They want direct school contact.

5. **Z visa verification is make-or-break:** Teachers won't even consider jobs without Z visa guarantee. This is non-negotiable.

================================================================================

## Out of Scope Pain Points:

1. **Switching jobs difficulty:** Hard to transfer work permits between employers. YouTeacher can't solve visa bureaucracy.

2. **General visa complexity:** The Z visa process is inherently complex (authentication, medical checks, etc). YouTeacher can provide guidance but can't simplify government process.

3. **Cost of living / salary negotiations:** Teachers want higher pay but YouTeacher doesn't set salaries.

4. **Cultural adjustment:** Loneliness, isolation, culture shock - not a job board problem.

================================================================================

## Strategic Implications for YouTeacher:

### MUST SOLVE (10/10 and 9/10 impact):
1. **Scam prevention:** Verified schools only, no fake listings, no payment schemes
2. **Z visa guarantee:** Only list schools that provide proper work permits
3. **Contract protection:** Pre-vetted schools, contract transparency, bad actor blacklist

### SHOULD SOLVE (8/10 and 7/10 impact):
4. **Information clarity:** Step-by-step guides, process transparency, FAQs
5. **No recruiters:** Direct school connections, no middle-men taking cuts
6. **School quality:** Review system, blacklist bad schools, teacher feedback

### NICE TO HAVE (6/10 impact):
7. **Flexible hiring filters:** Show schools open to older teachers, non-native speakers

## Competitive Differentiation:

The evidence shows existing platforms (Dave's ESL Cafe, eChinaCities, etc.) are **90%+ fake/scam listings**. YouTeacher can win by:
- **Trust:** Every listing is verified, no scams
- **Legal:** Z visa guarantee on all jobs
- **Direct:** No recruiter middle-men
- **Quality:** School reviews, blacklist enforcement

This is a **low bar** to clear - competitors have abandoned quality control.
